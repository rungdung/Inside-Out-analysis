# Inside Out analysis
 Playing around with creating a dataset for interactions between the characters in the movie Inside Out. Visualising using R.
 
 ## Current status
 The dataset at this point is filthy with incomplete data and I've only gone about 25 minutes into the movie....I'd like to better my workflow and clear my head about how I am going to categorise data before I move on.
