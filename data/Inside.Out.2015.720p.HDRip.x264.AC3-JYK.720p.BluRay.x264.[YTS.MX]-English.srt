2
00:00:49,994 --> 00:00:51,675
Do you ever look at
someone and wonder.

3
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,468
What is going on
inside their head?

4
00:00:54,493 --> 00:00:56,136
Well, I know.

5
00:00:56,161 --> 00:00:58,706
Well, I know Riley's head.

6
00:01:42,588 --> 00:01:45,343
And there she was.

7
00:01:46,551 --> 00:01:48,504
Hello.

8
00:01:49,455 --> 00:01:52,923
- Riley.
- Whoa. Look at you.

9
00:01:52,948 --> 00:01:55,876
Aren't you a little bundle of joy.

10
00:02:08,844 --> 00:02:11,190
<font color="#efeb9a">Whoa.</font>

11
00:02:28,253 --> 00:02:31,948
It was amazing.
Just Riley and me

12
00:02:31,973 --> 00:02:34,379
forever.

13
00:02:39,538 --> 00:02:40,779
Or for

14
00:02:40,804 --> 00:02:43,059
33 seconds.

15
00:02:44,012 --> 00:02:45,728
I'm Sadness.

16
00:02:45,753 --> 00:02:49,519
Oh, hello. I'm Joy. So.

17
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:51,271
Can I just, if you could...

18
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,591
I don't know, let me fix that.
Thanks.

19
00:02:53,616 --> 00:02:55,467
And that was just the beginning.

20
00:02:55,492 --> 00:02:58,554
Headquarters only got
more crowded from there.

21
00:03:00,241 --> 00:03:02,704
Very nice. Okay.
Looks like you got this.

22
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:04,019
Very good. Oh. Sharp! Sharp!

23
00:03:04,044 --> 00:03:05,050
NO, LOOK OUT!

24
00:03:05,075 --> 00:03:08,836
That's Fear.
He's really good at keeping Riley safe.

25
00:03:08,867 --> 00:03:10,113
Easy. Easy.

26
00:03:10,138 --> 00:03:11,585
Fall back! Oh, we're good.

27
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:12,655
We're good.

28
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,640
- Woo. Good job.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

29
00:03:14,927 --> 00:03:16,480
And. We're back.

30
00:03:17,432 --> 00:03:18,857
Whoa.

31
00:03:20,643 --> 00:03:22,435
Here we go, alright. Open.

32
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,133
- Hm. This looks new.
- Think it's safe?

33
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:25,468
- What is it?
- Ah...

34
00:03:25,493 --> 00:03:28,157
Okay, caution.
There is a dangerous smell people.

35
00:03:28,182 --> 00:03:29,255
Hold on. What is that?

36
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,488
This is Disgust.

37
00:03:30,513 --> 00:03:34,230
She basically keeps Riley from being
poison, physically and socially.

38
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,763
That is not brightly colored.

39
00:03:35,788 --> 00:03:37,587
Or shaped like a dinosaur.
Hold on guys.

40
00:03:37,612 --> 00:03:39,102
It's broccoli! Blah!

41
00:03:39,127 --> 00:03:40,571
Yuck!

42
00:03:41,907 --> 00:03:43,737
Well. I just saved our lives.

43
00:03:43,762 --> 00:03:44,815
Yeah. You're welcome.

44
00:03:44,847 --> 00:03:47,656
Riley, if you don't eat your dinner,
you're not going to get any dessert.

45
00:03:47,681 --> 00:03:50,006
Wait. Did he just say
we couldn't have dessert?

46
00:03:50,031 --> 00:03:51,562
That's Anger. He...

47
00:03:51,587 --> 00:03:54,459
cares very deeply about
things being fair.

48
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,358
So, that's how you
want to play it, old man.

49
00:03:56,383 --> 00:03:59,440
No dessert? Oh, sure.
We'll eat our dinner.

50
00:03:59,485 --> 00:04:01,678
Right after you eat this!

51
00:04:01,703 --> 00:04:03,570
Arh!

52
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,300
Riley, Riley.
Here comes an airplane.

53
00:04:08,945 --> 00:04:11,228
Oh, airplane.
We got an airplane, everybody.

54
00:04:11,253 --> 00:04:13,083
- Oh.
- Oh.

55
00:04:21,355 --> 00:04:23,071
And. you met Sadness.

56
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,258
She. Well, she.

57
00:04:29,219 --> 00:04:31,049
I'm not actually
sure what she does.

58
00:04:31,074 --> 00:04:33,713
And I've checked,
There's no place for her to go. So.

59
00:04:33,758 --> 00:04:36,854
She's good. We're good.
It's all great.

60
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:38,843
Anyway.
These are Riley's memories.

61
00:04:38,868 --> 00:04:41,920
And they are mostly happy if you notice,
not to brag.

62
00:04:46,738 --> 00:04:49,163
But the really important
ones are over here.

63
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:51,332
I don't want to get too technical
but these are called

64
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:53,011
core memories.

65
00:04:53,036 --> 00:04:56,587
Each one came from a super
important time in Riley's life.

66
00:04:56,612 --> 00:04:59,846
Like when she first scored a goal.
It was so amazing.

67
00:04:59,871 --> 00:05:01,566
Hey-hey! Would you look at that.

68
00:05:01,591 --> 00:05:03,188
Very nice.

69
00:05:03,765 --> 00:05:06,102
- Woo-hoo!
- Yeah!

70
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:20,869
And each core memory powers
a different aspect of Riley's personality.

71
00:05:20,894 --> 00:05:23,244
Like. Hockey Island.

72
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:28,022
Goofball Island
is my personal favorite.

73
00:05:28,299 --> 00:05:30,889
Come back here,
you little monkey!

74
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:35,424
Yup. Goofball is the best.

75
00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:38,223
Friendship Island is pretty good too.

76
00:05:39,735 --> 00:05:42,484
Oh. I love Honesty Island.

77
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,945
And that's the truth.

78
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,801
And of course,
Family Island is amazing.

79
00:05:48,276 --> 00:05:53,094
The point is. The islands are personality
are what make Riley, Riley.

80
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:55,551
Look out, Blue face.

81
00:06:01,149 --> 00:06:03,656
Lava! Hoo!

82
00:06:04,503 --> 00:06:08,694
- Who's your friend who likes to play?
- Bing Bong. Bing Bong.

83
00:06:08,766 --> 00:06:11,226
Hey, very nice.

84
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:16,787
- Agh.
- Brain freeze!

85
00:06:16,826 --> 00:06:18,378
- Agh!
- Awh!

86
00:06:18,403 --> 00:06:19,879
Aw.

87
00:06:23,864 --> 00:06:26,954
- Yeah!
- Yeh!

88
00:06:27,914 --> 00:06:31,182
- Good night, kiddo.
- Good night, Dad.

89
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:37,320
And...

90
00:06:37,345 --> 00:06:39,258
We're out.

91
00:06:39,283 --> 00:06:42,145
That's what I'm talking about.
Woo! Another perfect day.

92
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,403
Nice job everybody.

93
00:06:43,428 --> 00:06:46,070
Let's get those memories
down to long term.

94
00:06:50,414 --> 00:06:52,098
Alright. We did not die today.

95
00:06:52,123 --> 00:06:55,009
I call that an
unqualified success.

96
00:07:09,856 --> 00:07:12,203
And, that's it.
We love our girl.

97
00:07:12,228 --> 00:07:14,775
She's got great friends
and a great house.

98
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,748
Things couldn't be better.

99
00:07:16,773 --> 00:07:19,523
After all. Riley is 11 now.

100
00:07:19,548 --> 00:07:21,164
What could happen?

101
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:22,224
<font color="#ff8080">[VENDIDA] SOLD</font>

102
00:07:22,249 --> 00:07:23,644
- What?
- Aw!

103
00:07:23,669 --> 00:07:25,996
- Hnh!
- Aw!

104
00:07:28,004 --> 00:07:30,216
Okay. Not what I had in mind.

105
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,655
Aw!

106
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:57,818
Hey, look. The Golden Gate Bridge,
isn't that great?

107
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,220
It's not made up of solid
gold like we thought,

108
00:08:00,245 --> 00:08:02,391
which is kind of disappointed.
But still...

109
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,796
I sure am glad you told me
earthquakes are a myth, Joy.

110
00:08:04,821 --> 00:08:09,134
- Otherwise I be terrified right now.
- Yeah.

111
00:08:11,248 --> 00:08:13,609
These are my kind of people.

112
00:08:13,634 --> 00:08:15,030
Alright, just a few more blocks.

113
00:08:15,055 --> 00:08:17,330
- We're almost to our new house.
- Step on it, Daddy.

114
00:08:17,355 --> 00:08:20,525
Why can't we just live in the smelly car.
We're already been in it forever.

115
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,425
Which...
actually was really lucky.

116
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:24,298
Because that gave us
plenty of time to think

117
00:08:24,323 --> 00:08:26,270
about what our new house
is going to look like.

118
00:08:26,295 --> 00:08:29,162
What? Let's review
the top 5 daydreams.

119
00:08:29,187 --> 00:08:31,002
- Woo, that looks safe.
- That looks nice.

120
00:08:31,027 --> 00:08:33,637
Oh. This will be great for Riley.
Oh! No, no, no... this one.

121
00:08:33,662 --> 00:08:35,937
Joy for the last time.
She cannot live in a cookie.

122
00:08:35,962 --> 00:08:38,894
That's the one.
It comes with a dragon.

123
00:08:39,675 --> 00:08:42,002
Are we getting close?
I can feel it.

124
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:44,854
Here it is.
Here's our new house.

125
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:46,781
And...

126
00:08:52,141 --> 00:08:55,168
Maybe, it's nice on the inside.

127
00:08:59,742 --> 00:09:01,643
- We're suppose to live here?
- Do we have to?

128
00:09:01,668 --> 00:09:03,785
I'm telling you, it smells
that something died in here.

129
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,544
- Can you die from moving?
- Guys, you are overreacting.

130
00:09:06,569 --> 00:09:09,092
- Nobody is dieing.
- A dead mouse!

131
00:09:09,117 --> 00:09:10,336
- Great.
- I'm gonna be sick.

132
00:09:10,361 --> 00:09:11,272
It's a house of the dead.
What're we gonna do?

133
00:09:11,297 --> 00:09:13,825
- We're gonna get rabies.
- Get off from me!

134
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,371
Hey, hey, hey.
All through the drive,

135
00:09:15,396 --> 00:09:17,681
Dad talked about how cool
our new room is.

136
00:09:17,705 --> 00:09:19,648
- Let's go check it out.
- It's gonna be great.

137
00:09:19,673 --> 00:09:20,911
Yes, yes, yes...

138
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:23,241
- No, no, no...
- I'm starting to envy the dead mouse.

139
00:09:23,266 --> 00:09:25,679
Get out the rubber ball.
We're in solitary confinement.

140
00:09:25,717 --> 00:09:27,628
- Riley can't live here.
- She's right.

141
00:09:27,653 --> 00:09:29,200
- Really bad.
- It's absolutely the worst.

142
00:09:29,225 --> 00:09:30,419
- This house stinks.
- It's the worst place

143
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:32,029
- I've been in my entire life.
- Oh, yeah.

144
00:09:32,054 --> 00:09:34,565
Hey, it's nothing our
butterfly curtains couldn't fix.

145
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,972
I read somewhere that an
empty room is an opportunity.

146
00:09:36,997 --> 00:09:37,805
Where did you read that?

147
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,488
It doesn't matter. I
read it and it's great.

148
00:09:39,513 --> 00:09:41,832
We'll put the bed there.
And the desk over there.

149
00:09:41,857 --> 00:09:43,174
The hock lamp goes there.

150
00:09:43,199 --> 00:09:45,459
- Put the chair there.
- Oh, the trophy collections.

151
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:46,864
- There...
- Stars!

152
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:48,619
- I like that.
- Now, we're talking.

153
00:09:48,644 --> 00:09:50,855
Let's go get our stuff
from the moving van.

154
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,292
Alright. Goodbye.
Well, guess what?

155
00:09:53,317 --> 00:09:55,248
The moving van won't
be here till next Thursday.

156
00:09:55,273 --> 00:09:56,751
Your kidding.

157
00:09:56,868 --> 00:10:00,071
Our van is lost?
It's the worst day ever.

158
00:10:00,872 --> 00:10:03,139
- You said it would be here yesterday.
- And I know that's what I said.

159
00:10:03,164 --> 00:10:05,000
- That's what they told me.
- Mom and Dad are stress out.

160
00:10:05,025 --> 00:10:07,406
- They are stress out. - Arguing.
- What're we going to do.

161
00:10:07,987 --> 00:10:10,260
- What's their problem?
- I've got a great idea.

162
00:10:10,285 --> 00:10:12,132
Did you even read the contract?

163
00:10:12,157 --> 00:10:14,537
Anderson makes her move.
She's closing in.

164
00:10:14,562 --> 00:10:16,889
Hey. Oh no, you're not.

165
00:10:16,914 --> 00:10:19,437
- She's running for the shot.
- Coming behind you, watch out.

166
00:10:19,462 --> 00:10:21,643
And she scores! Yeah!

167
00:10:21,674 --> 00:10:23,578
- Woo-hoo.
- Yo-ho.

168
00:10:23,603 --> 00:10:25,206
Come on. Grandma.

169
00:10:25,231 --> 00:10:26,747
Ha. Grandma?

170
00:10:26,772 --> 00:10:29,589
Oh-oh, she put her hair up.
We're in for it.

171
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:33,399
Heyyy. Put me down.

172
00:10:33,653 --> 00:10:35,052
- Eh-heh-heh.
- Ha-ha.

173
00:10:36,918 --> 00:10:38,574
Sorry, hold on.

174
00:10:39,626 --> 00:10:41,523
- Hello.
- Wait. What.

175
00:10:41,548 --> 00:10:43,133
You're kidding.

176
00:10:43,772 --> 00:10:46,433
Alright. Stall for me,
I'll be right there.

177
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:49,441
The investors are suppose to
show up on Thursday, not today.

178
00:10:49,658 --> 00:10:52,311
- I got to go.
- It's okay, we get it.

179
00:10:52,336 --> 00:10:56,003
You're the best. Thanks hon.
See you, sweetie.

180
00:10:56,582 --> 00:10:57,911
Dad just left us.

181
00:10:57,936 --> 00:11:01,087
Oh, he doesn't love us anymore.
That's sad.

182
00:11:01,112 --> 00:11:02,984
I should drive, right?

183
00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:06,446
Joy. What are you doing?

184
00:11:06,471 --> 00:11:08,810
Just you. give me 1 second.

185
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:13,192
You know what I've realised.
Riley hasn't had lunch. Remember?

186
00:11:14,892 --> 00:11:18,549
Hey, I saw a pizza place down the street.
Maybe we can try that.

187
00:11:18,579 --> 00:11:20,543
- Pizza sounds delicious.
- Pizza.

188
00:11:20,574 --> 00:11:22,762
- Yeah, pizza.
- Pizza. Great idea. Let's get it.

189
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,567
- What the heck is that?
- Who puts broccoli on pizza.

190
00:11:26,592 --> 00:11:27,698
That's it. I'm done.

191
00:11:27,723 --> 00:11:31,014
Congratulation San Francisco.
You ruined pizza.

192
00:11:31,043 --> 00:11:34,727
First the Hawaiians.
And now you.

193
00:11:34,752 --> 00:11:37,672
What kind of a pizza place
only serves 1 kind of pizza.

194
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,251
Must be a San Francisco thing.

195
00:11:40,276 --> 00:11:43,099
Still, it's not as bad as the soup
at that diner in Nebraska.

196
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:47,519
Oh, yeah. The spoon stood up
in the soup by itself.

197
00:11:47,725 --> 00:11:50,560
We're good. Family's running.

198
00:11:50,727 --> 00:11:53,983
The drive out was pretty fun.
What was your favorite part?

199
00:11:54,008 --> 00:11:55,470
Spitting out of the car window.

200
00:11:55,495 --> 00:11:58,170
- Definitely not when Dad was singing.
- Wearing the sit belt.

201
00:11:58,199 --> 00:12:00,428
Oh. What about the time
with the dinosaur.

202
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:02,134
- Oh, that's the one.
- That was great.

203
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:03,393
Say cheese.

204
00:12:03,418 --> 00:12:05,126
- Dad. Dad. Dad - Honey.

205
00:12:05,151 --> 00:12:06,944
Dad, look at the car.
Just look behind you.

206
00:12:06,969 --> 00:12:08,991
No-no-no...

207
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,815
No! Aw.

208
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,826
Nice one, Joy.

209
00:12:11,851 --> 00:12:15,262
I like that time with the dinosaur.
That was pretty funny.

210
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:24,523
Wait, what. What happened?

211
00:12:25,346 --> 00:12:27,782
She did something to the memory.

212
00:12:27,939 --> 00:12:30,474
- What did you do?
- I-I just touched it.

213
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,356
- That shouldn't make it change.
- Oh. Change it back, Joy.

214
00:12:32,381 --> 00:12:33,641
- I'm trying.
- You can't change it back?

215
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,668
- No. I guess I can't.
- Good going, Sadness.

216
00:12:35,693 --> 00:12:39,308
Now when Riley thinks of that moment
with Dad, she's gonna feel sad. Bravo.

217
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:45,023
I'm sorry, Joy. I don't really know.
I thought maybe if you, if you, I mean...

218
00:12:45,052 --> 00:12:48,000
Joy.
We got a stairway coming up.

219
00:12:49,177 --> 00:12:52,163
Just don't touch any other memories
until we figured out what's going on.

220
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,450
- Okay.
- Alright.

221
00:12:53,475 --> 00:12:58,918
Get ready. This is the monster railing
and we are riding it all the way down.

222
00:13:04,991 --> 00:13:07,250
Wait, what. What happened?

223
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,472
- A core memory!
- Oh no.

224
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,781
- Sadness, what're you doing?
- It looked like one was crooked

225
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:19,435
So I opened it and it fell out.
I.

226
00:13:22,604 --> 00:13:24,511
Woo-hoo!

227
00:13:24,544 --> 00:13:27,656
It's just that. I want to,
maybe. hold one.

228
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:29,839
- Joy!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

229
00:13:30,823 --> 00:13:33,133
Sadness. You nearly
touch a core memory.

230
00:13:33,158 --> 00:13:35,370
And when you touch them,
we can't change them back.

231
00:13:35,395 --> 00:13:38,457
Oh, I know. I'm sorry.
Something's wrong with me.

232
00:13:38,482 --> 00:13:40,853
I... It's like
I'm having a break down.

233
00:13:40,878 --> 00:13:42,770
You're not having a break down.
It's stress.

234
00:13:42,795 --> 00:13:45,733
I keep making mistakes like that.
I'm awful.

235
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,784
- Oh, you're not.
- And annoying.

236
00:13:47,813 --> 00:13:49,882
They, well... You know what.

237
00:13:49,907 --> 00:13:51,850
You can't focus on
what's going wrong.

238
00:13:51,888 --> 00:13:53,608
There's always a way
to turn things around

239
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:55,341
To find the fun.

240
00:13:55,366 --> 00:13:58,770
Yeah, find the fun.
I don't know how to do that.

241
00:13:58,795 --> 00:14:02,739
Okay, well.
Try to think of something funny.

242
00:14:02,847 --> 00:14:06,227
Oh. Remember the funny movie
where the dog dies?

243
00:14:06,252 --> 00:14:08,279
Oh, yeah. That's not...

244
00:14:08,304 --> 00:14:09,834
What about that time, with Mag.

245
00:14:09,859 --> 00:14:14,979
When Riley laughed so hard,
milk came out of her nose.

246
00:14:15,004 --> 00:14:16,098
Come on.

247
00:14:16,123 --> 00:14:19,206
Yeah, that hurts.
It felt like fire.

248
00:14:19,231 --> 00:14:20,703
- It was awf...
- Okay, okay.

249
00:14:20,728 --> 00:14:22,670
Don't think of that.
Let's try something else.

250
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:26,129
- What're your favorite things to do.
- My favorite?

251
00:14:26,172 --> 00:14:27,910
Well, I like it
when we're outside.

252
00:14:27,936 --> 00:14:31,126
That's good! Like, there's
the beach and sunshine.

253
00:14:31,151 --> 00:14:34,128
Oh. Like the time we buried
Dad in the sand up to his neck.

254
00:14:34,153 --> 00:14:37,267
I was thinking more like rain.

255
00:14:37,795 --> 00:14:41,024
Rain Rain is my favorite too!

256
00:14:41,049 --> 00:14:42,723
We can stomp around the puddles

257
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:46,232
You know.
There's cool umbrellas, lightning storms.

258
00:14:46,257 --> 00:14:50,340
More like when the rain went south and bad,
that makes our shoe soggy.

259
00:14:50,365 --> 00:14:56,089
And we get all cold, shivery and
everything starts feeling droopy.

260
00:14:56,114 --> 00:14:58,425
Oh. Hey, hey, hey. Easy.

261
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,654
Why are you crying?

262
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:04,145
It's... It's really the opposite
of what we're going for here.

263
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:09,640
Crying helps me slow down and not
obsessive worried of life's problems.

264
00:15:09,665 --> 00:15:12,591
You know what?
Let's think about something else.

265
00:15:12,616 --> 00:15:16,141
How about we read some mind manuals.
Sounds fun.

266
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,489
I've read most of them.

267
00:15:17,514 --> 00:15:19,467
Well. Have you read this one.
This seem interesting.

268
00:15:19,492 --> 00:15:22,730
Long term memory retrieval.
Volume 47.

269
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,228
- No.
- Woo. A real page turner.

270
00:15:25,253 --> 00:15:29,247
Long term memory data selection
via channel sober be.

271
00:15:29,272 --> 00:15:31,550
See. Fun already.
Oh, you lucky dog.

272
00:15:31,575 --> 00:15:36,495
You're reading these cool things,
I got to go work. Life is so unfair.

273
00:15:42,071 --> 00:15:44,031
Ugh.

274
00:15:44,466 --> 00:15:48,288
What can we do. We only got
capital that'll last a month maybe two.

275
00:15:48,313 --> 00:15:51,750
If we can't find investors by then,
we're gonna have to lay people off.

276
00:15:51,775 --> 00:15:55,000
Mom. Dad.
Come kiss me good night.

277
00:15:55,025 --> 00:15:59,072
- I know. I know. We got to land this, okay.
- Be right there.

278
00:16:01,796 --> 00:16:05,259
Did you hear Dad?
He sounded really upset.

279
00:16:07,505 --> 00:16:09,405
What was that? Was it a bear?
It's a bear!

280
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,065
There are no bears
in San Francisco.

281
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:13,189
I saw a really hairy guy.
He looked like a bear.

282
00:16:13,214 --> 00:16:15,393
Oh. I'm so jumpy, my
nerves are shocked.

283
00:16:15,418 --> 00:16:17,070
Ew. I don't wanna
hear about your nerves.

284
00:16:17,095 --> 00:16:19,767
I'll tell you what it is.
This move has been a bust.

285
00:16:19,792 --> 00:16:21,389
That's what I've been
telling you guys.

286
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:23,768
There're at least 37 things for
Riley to be scared of right now.

287
00:16:23,793 --> 00:16:25,435
This smell alone is enough
to make her gag.

288
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,413
I can't believe Mom and
Dad moved us here.

289
00:16:27,438 --> 00:16:29,866
Look. I get it.
You guys have concerns.

290
00:16:29,891 --> 00:16:31,326
But we've been through worst.

291
00:16:31,352 --> 00:16:35,345
Tell you what. Let's make a list of all
the things Riley should be happy about.

292
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,956
Fine. Let's see.
This house stinks. Our room stinks.

293
00:16:37,981 --> 00:16:39,966
- Pizza is weird here.
- Our friends are back home.

294
00:16:39,991 --> 00:16:42,206
And all our stuff
is in the missing van.

295
00:16:42,231 --> 00:16:43,687
Oh, come on. It could be worse.

296
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:47,256
Yeah, Joy. We could be lying
on a dirty floor. In a bag.

297
00:16:47,281 --> 00:16:49,375
Okay, I admit it.
We had a rough start.

298
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,415
- But think of all the good things that...
- No, Joy.

299
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,681
There is absolutely no reason
for Riley to be happy right now.

300
00:16:54,706 --> 00:16:55,698
Let us handle this.

301
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:58,329
I say we skip school tomorrow and
lock ourselves in the bedroom.

302
00:16:58,354 --> 00:17:00,034
We have no clean clothes

303
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:01,841
And we could cry until we can't breathe.

304
00:17:01,866 --> 00:17:04,620
We should lock the door and
scream the curse word we know.

305
00:17:04,645 --> 00:17:06,555
- It's a good one.
- Now, hold on.

306
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:09,533
Look. We all have our off days.
You know...

307
00:17:09,558 --> 00:17:10,594
Hi honey.

308
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:14,641
The Mom bad news Train is pulling in.
Toot-toot.

309
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,695
Still no moving van. Uh-huh.

310
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,389
Now they're saying it won't be here
till Tuesday. Can you believe it.

311
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:20,656
Toot-toot-toot.

312
00:17:20,681 --> 00:17:22,741
- Where's Dad?
- On the phone.

313
00:17:22,766 --> 00:17:24,709
This new adventure is
keeping him pretty busy.

314
00:17:24,734 --> 00:17:27,482
I rest my case.

315
00:17:30,157 --> 00:17:33,886
Now, for a few well place
withering scowls.

316
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:36,906
I guess all I really
want to say is

317
00:17:36,937 --> 00:17:38,284
thank you.

318
00:17:38,309 --> 00:17:42,735
You know.
Through all these confusion you stayed...

319
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,627
Well, you stayed our happy girl.

320
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,811
Your Dad is under
a lot of pressure.

321
00:17:47,836 --> 00:17:52,137
But, if you and I can keep smiling,
it would be a big help.

322
00:17:52,162 --> 00:17:55,439
We can do that for him. Right?

323
00:17:55,469 --> 00:17:57,120
Whoa.

324
00:17:57,472 --> 00:17:58,976
Well.

325
00:18:00,195 --> 00:18:02,159
Yeah. Sure.

326
00:18:02,184 --> 00:18:04,892
What did we do to deserve you.

327
00:18:07,891 --> 00:18:10,383
- Sweet dreams.
- Good night.

328
00:18:11,025 --> 00:18:12,669
Well. You can't argue with Mom.

329
00:18:12,694 --> 00:18:13,853
- Happy it is.
- Can't argue with Mom, that's true.

330
00:18:13,878 --> 00:18:16,537
- Team Happy. Sounds great.
- Totally behind you, Joy.

331
00:18:17,294 --> 00:18:19,057
Looks like we're
going into R E M.

332
00:18:19,082 --> 00:18:22,093
I've got dream duty so I'll take care
of sending these to long term.

333
00:18:22,124 --> 00:18:26,608
Great day today, guys.
All is well, team Happy.

334
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:30,712
Alright.
What's on tonight, dream production?

335
00:18:35,742 --> 00:18:38,345
Now. This is it. The new place.

336
00:18:40,732 --> 00:18:43,613
Come live with me, Riley.

337
00:18:43,638 --> 00:18:48,440
- Somebody ordered a broccoli pizza.
- Eat me, I'm organic.

338
00:18:49,252 --> 00:18:52,261
Now. Who is in charge of
programming down there?

339
00:18:52,286 --> 00:18:55,384
I know I'm not suppose to do this.
But.

340
00:18:59,462 --> 00:19:02,527
We are not going to
end the day like this.

341
00:19:45,515 --> 00:19:47,165
Don't you worry.

342
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:51,249
I'm going to make sure that
tomorrow is another great day.

343
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:53,431
I promise.

344
00:20:01,776 --> 00:20:03,719
<font color="#00cece">CARAMEL CORN CURLS</font>

345
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:08,142
- Hello. Did I wake you?
- Do you have to play that?

346
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:09,441
Well, I have to practice.

347
00:20:09,466 --> 00:20:12,889
And I don't think of it as playing
so much as hugging

348
00:20:12,914 --> 00:20:15,776
Okay. First day of school.
Very, very exciting.

349
00:20:15,801 --> 00:20:18,801
I was up late last night figuring out
a new plan. Here it is.

350
00:20:18,826 --> 00:20:20,053
- Fear. I need a list - What?

351
00:20:20,078 --> 00:20:23,171
Of all the possible negative outcomes
on the first day at a new school.

352
00:20:23,196 --> 00:20:25,424
Way ahead of you there.
They won't notice no meteor.

353
00:20:25,449 --> 00:20:27,460
Disgust.
Make sure Riley stands out today.

354
00:20:27,485 --> 00:20:28,819
But, also blends in.

355
00:20:28,856 --> 00:20:30,786
When I'm through, Riley will
look so good,

356
00:20:30,811 --> 00:20:33,019
the other kids will look at
their own outfits and fart.

357
00:20:33,044 --> 00:20:35,646
Joy! Yes, Joy.
You'll be in charge of the console.

358
00:20:35,671 --> 00:20:37,093
Keeping Riley happy
all day long.

359
00:20:37,118 --> 00:20:38,823
And may I add, I love your dress,
it's adorable.

360
00:20:38,848 --> 00:20:42,242
Oh, this old thing. Thank you so much.
I love the way it twirls.

361
00:20:42,724 --> 00:20:45,140
Train of Thought,
right on schedule.

362
00:20:46,643 --> 00:20:48,573
Anger. Unload the daydreams.

363
00:20:48,598 --> 00:20:50,847
I ordered extra,
in case things get slow in class.

364
00:20:50,872 --> 00:20:54,163
Might come in handy. If this new school
is full of boring, useless classes.

365
00:20:54,188 --> 00:20:55,849
Which it probably will be.

366
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,629
Oh, Sadness. I've a super
important job just for you.

367
00:20:59,654 --> 00:21:02,312
- Really.
- Uh-heh. Follow me.

368
00:21:03,797 --> 00:21:06,352
- What are you doing?
- And there. Perfect.

369
00:21:06,377 --> 00:21:08,472
This is the circle of sadness.

370
00:21:08,497 --> 00:21:13,064
Your job is to make sure that
all the sadness stays inside of it.

371
00:21:13,089 --> 00:21:15,727
So, you want me
just to stand here?

372
00:21:15,752 --> 00:21:18,721
Hey, it's not my place to
tell you how to do your job.

373
00:21:18,746 --> 00:21:20,085
Just make sure that

374
00:21:20,116 --> 00:21:23,603
all... the sadness
stays in the circle.

375
00:21:23,628 --> 00:21:26,789
See. You're a pro at this.
Isn't this fun?

376
00:21:26,814 --> 00:21:27,991
- No.
- Atta girl.

377
00:21:28,016 --> 00:21:29,389
Alright everyone, fresh start.

378
00:21:29,414 --> 00:21:31,454
We're going to have a good day
which will turn into a good week,

379
00:21:31,479 --> 00:21:34,149
which will turn into a good year,
which will turn into a good life!

380
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:37,246
So, big day.
New school. New friends.

381
00:21:37,271 --> 00:21:39,652
I know. I'm kind of nervous
but I'm mostly excited.

382
00:21:39,677 --> 00:21:42,736
- How do I look? Do you like my quote?
- Very cute.

383
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:44,694
You gonna be okay.
You want us to walk with you?

384
00:21:44,725 --> 00:21:47,297
Mom and Dad, with us in public.
No, thank you.

385
00:21:47,322 --> 00:21:48,370
Yup, I'm on it.

386
00:21:48,395 --> 00:21:50,788
Nope, I'm fine.
Bye Mom. Bye Dad.

387
00:21:50,813 --> 00:21:52,294
Have a good day in school, monkey.

388
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:55,199
- Woo-woo...
- Woo-woot...
- Woo... Woo...

389
00:21:57,595 --> 00:21:59,877
Have a great day, sweetheart.

390
00:22:05,871 --> 00:22:07,889
- Are you sure we want to do this?
- In we go.

391
00:22:07,914 --> 00:22:11,066
Okay, going in. Yes.

392
00:22:15,303 --> 00:22:17,640
Okay. We've got a group of
cool girls at 2 o'clock.

393
00:22:17,665 --> 00:22:20,317
- How do you know?
- Double ears pierce. Infinity scarf.

394
00:22:20,342 --> 00:22:23,030
- Whoa. Is she wearing eye shadow?
- Yeah. We want to be friends with them.

395
00:22:23,068 --> 00:22:24,487
- Let's go talk to them.
- Are you kidding.

396
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:27,227
We're not talking to them.
We want them to like us.

397
00:22:27,252 --> 00:22:28,520
Oh... yeah. Wait. What?

398
00:22:28,545 --> 00:22:30,627
Almost finished with
the potential disasters.

399
00:22:30,652 --> 00:22:34,173
Worst scenario is either quicksands,
spontaneous combustion

400
00:22:34,198 --> 00:22:37,147
or getting called on by the teacher.
As long as none of those happens...

401
00:22:37,172 --> 00:22:39,942
Okay, everybody.
We have a new student in class today.

402
00:22:39,967 --> 00:22:43,383
Are you kidding me! Out of the days!
This is not happening!

403
00:22:43,408 --> 00:22:46,016
Riley, would you like to tell us
something about yourself?

404
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:48,396
No!
Pretend we can't speak English.

405
00:22:48,421 --> 00:22:50,453
Don't worry. I got this.

406
00:22:51,372 --> 00:22:52,758
Okay.

407
00:22:52,783 --> 00:22:54,521
My name is Riley Anderson.

408
00:22:54,553 --> 00:22:58,547
I'm from Minnesota
and now I live here.

409
00:22:59,794 --> 00:23:02,219
And how about Minnesota?

410
00:23:02,244 --> 00:23:03,663
Can you tell us something about it?

411
00:23:03,688 --> 00:23:06,659
Well you certainly get
a lot more snow than we do.

412
00:23:07,244 --> 00:23:10,972
Ha-ha-ha. She's hilarious.

413
00:23:11,575 --> 00:23:13,124
Yeah, it get's pretty cold.

414
00:23:13,149 --> 00:23:15,635
The lake freezes over.
And that's when we play hockey.

415
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:18,068
I'm on a great team.
We're called the Prairie dogs.

416
00:23:18,093 --> 00:23:21,403
My friend, Mag, plays forward
and my dad's the coach.

417
00:23:21,428 --> 00:23:23,919
Pretty much everyone in my family skates.

418
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,414
It's kind of a family tradition.

419
00:23:25,438 --> 00:23:28,353
We go out on the lake
almost every weekend.

420
00:23:30,002 --> 00:23:31,825
Or, we did. Till...

421
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:33,114
I moved away.

422
00:23:33,139 --> 00:23:34,409
- Hey. What gives?
- What?

423
00:23:34,434 --> 00:23:36,874
Hey, Sadness.
You touched a memory.

424
00:23:36,899 --> 00:23:39,976
- We talked about this.
- Oh yeah, I know. But I...

425
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:41,589
Get back in your circle.

426
00:23:41,614 --> 00:23:43,076
Ah. What's going on?

427
00:23:43,101 --> 00:23:45,053
- Get it out of there, Joy.
- Eject.

428
00:23:45,129 --> 00:23:47,529
We used to play tag and stuff.

429
00:23:47,554 --> 00:23:49,457
Cool kids whispering at 3 o'clock.

430
00:23:49,482 --> 00:23:52,340
Did you see that look?
They're judging us.

431
00:23:52,952 --> 00:23:55,718
Somebody help grab that thing.
Everybody put in...

432
00:23:55,743 --> 00:23:58,521
But, everything is different now.

433
00:23:58,777 --> 00:24:00,649
Since we moved.

434
00:24:02,243 --> 00:24:05,696
Oh no. We're crying and sloth.

435
00:24:05,721 --> 00:24:08,791
What?
Sadness, what are you doing!

436
00:24:09,846 --> 00:24:12,990
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm, oh.

437
00:24:13,397 --> 00:24:16,921
- It's a core memory.
- But, it's blue.

438
00:24:17,784 --> 00:24:19,259
No! Wait!

439
00:24:19,284 --> 00:24:20,915
Stop it. No.

440
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,433
No.

441
00:24:28,568 --> 00:24:30,003
Joy. No.

442
00:24:30,028 --> 00:24:31,384
- That's a core memory.
- Hey!

443
00:24:31,409 --> 00:24:33,379
- Stop it. Let go.
- Don't. Wait.

444
00:24:33,765 --> 00:24:35,713
The core memories!

445
00:24:39,534 --> 00:24:40,900
Aw!

446
00:24:49,848 --> 00:24:51,513
No-no-no...

447
00:24:55,633 --> 00:24:57,189
- Aw!
- Aw!

448
00:25:04,396 --> 00:25:05,672
Thank you, Riley.

449
00:25:05,697 --> 00:25:08,103
I know it can be tough
moving to a new place.

450
00:25:08,128 --> 00:25:10,781
But we are happy
to have you here.

451
00:25:10,806 --> 00:25:13,068
Alright everyone.
Get out you history books.

452
00:25:13,093 --> 00:25:15,514
And turn to chapter 7.

453
00:25:17,158 --> 00:25:19,759
Can I say that curse word now?

454
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:21,821
- Eh.
- Aw!

455
00:25:24,026 --> 00:25:25,755
Aw!

456
00:25:30,673 --> 00:25:34,081
Aww...!

457
00:25:36,692 --> 00:25:38,998
Aww...

458
00:25:40,095 --> 00:25:43,723
Oh no. 1, 2, 3, okay.

459
00:25:44,629 --> 00:25:46,968
Not enough. What?

460
00:25:46,992 --> 00:25:47,992
Where are we?

461
00:25:48,293 --> 00:25:49,992
Long term memory?

462
00:25:50,016 --> 00:25:51,092
What?

463
00:25:57,993 --> 00:25:59,092
Goof Ball Island?

464
00:26:00,816 --> 00:26:03,916
Riley's Island of Personality,
they're all down!

465
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,040
Ohh...
This is bad!

466
00:26:07,064 --> 00:26:09,064
We...we can fix this.

467
00:26:09,088 --> 00:26:11,088
We just have to get back to headquarter's.

468
00:26:11,112 --> 00:26:13,112
Plug the core memories in...

469
00:26:13,136 --> 00:26:14,936
And Riley will go back to normal.

470
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,960
Ohhh... Riley is no core memories.

471
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,992
No personality island and no...

472
00:26:21,193 --> 00:26:22,292
What?
What is it?

473
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:23,916
You.

474
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,940
You're not in headquarter's.

475
00:26:25,964 --> 00:26:28,064
Without you Riley can't be happy.

476
00:26:28,788 --> 00:26:30,788
We gotta get you back up there.

477
00:26:31,412 --> 00:26:32,912
I'm coming Riley.

478
00:26:46,736 --> 00:26:50,136


479
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,560


480
00:26:51,584 --> 00:26:53,384


481
00:26:53,408 --> 00:26:54,608


482
00:26:54,832 --> 00:26:57,032


483
00:26:57,056 --> 00:26:58,156


484
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:00,280


485
00:27:00,304 --> 00:27:01,404


486
00:27:01,428 --> 00:27:02,428


487
00:27:02,452 --> 00:27:05,752


488
00:27:05,776 --> 00:27:06,776


489
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,900


490
00:27:10,124 --> 00:27:12,124


491
00:27:12,148 --> 00:27:15,148


492
00:27:15,172 --> 00:27:17,872


493
00:27:17,896 --> 00:27:19,396


494
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,120


495
00:27:21,144 --> 00:27:22,344


496
00:27:22,368 --> 00:27:24,068


497
00:27:24,069 --> 00:27:26,069


498
00:27:27,293 --> 00:27:29,993


499
00:27:30,917 --> 00:27:32,817


500
00:27:32,841 --> 00:27:35,141


501
00:27:37,665 --> 00:27:39,065


502
00:27:39,989 --> 00:27:41,989


503
00:27:42,013 --> 00:27:42,913


504
00:27:42,914 --> 00:27:44,914


505
00:27:44,938 --> 00:27:46,938


506
00:27:46,962 --> 00:27:48,162


507
00:27:48,163 --> 00:27:50,163


508
00:27:50,187 --> 00:27:52,187


509
00:27:52,211 --> 00:27:55,911


510
00:27:55,935 --> 00:27:58,735


511
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:02,259


512
00:28:02,283 --> 00:28:05,083


513
00:28:05,084 --> 00:28:07,584


514
00:28:10,993 --> 00:28:14,787
What a nice pass, over to Reed.
Constance cross the line.

515
00:28:17,844 --> 00:28:20,034
Uh-oh. She's looking at us.

516
00:28:20,586 --> 00:28:21,979
- What did she say?
- What?

517
00:28:22,004 --> 00:28:23,863
Oh, sorry sir.
No one was listening.

518
00:28:23,888 --> 00:28:26,229
Isn't it garbage night?
We let the toilet seat up.

519
00:28:26,254 --> 00:28:28,385
What? What is it, woman? What?

520
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:32,450
- He's making that stupid face again.
- I could strangle him right now.

521
00:28:32,475 --> 00:28:34,674
Signal him again.

522
00:28:36,091 --> 00:28:37,651
Ah. So.

523
00:28:37,676 --> 00:28:39,014
Riley, how was school?

524
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,904
- Aw. Waste of time.
- You got to be kidding me. - Seriously?

525
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:44,292
For this, we gave up that
Brazilian helicopter pilot?

526
00:28:44,317 --> 00:28:46,175
Move! I'll be joy.

527
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,261
School was great. Alright.

528
00:28:48,286 --> 00:28:50,826
Riley. Is everything okay?

529
00:28:51,755 --> 00:28:53,540
Sir,
she just rolled her eyes at us.

530
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:54,897
What is her deal?

531
00:28:54,929 --> 00:28:58,267
Alright, make a show of force.
I don't want to have to put the foot down.

532
00:28:58,292 --> 00:29:00,214
No. Not the foot.

533
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:02,628
Riley,
I do not like this new attitude.

534
00:29:02,653 --> 00:29:04,382
Oh.
I'll show you attitude, old man.

535
00:29:04,407 --> 00:29:05,860
No-no-no-no. Stay happy.

536
00:29:06,416 --> 00:29:08,695
What is your problem?
Just leave me alone.

537
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,900
Sir.
Reporting high level of sass.

538
00:29:10,925 --> 00:29:12,510
Take it to DEFCON 2.

539
00:29:12,535 --> 00:29:15,233
Your heard that gentlemen.
DEFCON 2.

540
00:29:15,757 --> 00:29:19,365
Listen, young lady. I don't know where
this disrespectful attitude came from.

541
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:22,252
You want a piece of this, pops.
Come and get it!

542
00:29:22,277 --> 00:29:24,024
Yeah. Well. Well.

543
00:29:24,049 --> 00:29:27,057
Here it comes. Prepare the foot.

544
00:29:27,762 --> 00:29:29,894
Keys, to exec position.

545
00:29:31,084 --> 00:29:33,621
Ready to launch
on your command, sir.

546
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,570
AW!

547
00:29:35,595 --> 00:29:37,474
Just, shut up!

548
00:29:38,175 --> 00:29:39,659
Fire.

549
00:29:39,684 --> 00:29:41,917
That's it. Go to your room.

550
00:29:42,342 --> 00:29:44,120
Now.

551
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:50,336
Foot is down. The foot is down.

552
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:54,872
Good job, gentlemen.
That could've been a disaster.

553
00:29:54,913 --> 00:29:57,025
Well, that was a disaster.

554
00:29:59,932 --> 00:30:03,567
Come.
Fly with me, criancinha. (baby)

555
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,597
- Ah.
- Ahh.

556
00:30:14,796 --> 00:30:17,919
We're gonna walk
out there, on that?

557
00:30:17,944 --> 00:30:19,617
It's the quickest way back.

558
00:30:19,655 --> 00:30:24,234
But it's right over the Memory Dump.
If we fall, we'll be forgotten forever.

559
00:30:24,259 --> 00:30:26,116
We have to do this for Riley.

560
00:30:26,141 --> 00:30:28,408
Just follow my footsteps.

561
00:30:28,433 --> 00:30:31,608
Not that high. It's totally, ah.

562
00:30:39,438 --> 00:30:41,514
Wooah.

563
00:30:47,702 --> 00:30:49,257
Hey.

564
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,970
So...

565
00:30:50,995 --> 00:30:53,654
Things got a little out
of hand downstairs.

566
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,790
You wanna talk about it?

567
00:30:56,606 --> 00:30:59,581
Come on. Where's my happy girl?

568
00:31:00,712 --> 00:31:02,522
Monkey. Woo-hoo.

569
00:31:02,547 --> 00:31:05,497
Whoa!
He's trying to start up Goofball.

570
00:31:05,921 --> 00:31:09,265
Come on. Hoo-Haa.

571
00:31:19,546 --> 00:31:21,592
Sadness! Turn right back!

572
00:31:49,135 --> 00:31:50,809
What the?

573
00:32:05,724 --> 00:32:09,562
I get it.
You need some alone time.

574
00:32:11,289 --> 00:32:13,242
And we'll talk later.

575
00:32:16,303 --> 00:32:20,827
- We have a major problem.
- Oh, Joy. Where are you?

576
00:32:21,232 --> 00:32:23,873
We lost Goofball Island.

577
00:32:23,898 --> 00:32:28,792
That means she can lose Friendship
and Hockey and Honesty and Family.

578
00:32:28,817 --> 00:32:31,184
You can fixed this. Right, Joy?

579
00:32:31,209 --> 00:32:34,784
- I-I don't know.
- Oh.

580
00:32:34,809 --> 00:32:37,662
But we have to try.
Okay, come on.

581
00:32:38,475 --> 00:32:40,473
- Riley's gone to sleep.
- Oh.

582
00:32:40,498 --> 00:32:43,853
Which is a good thing
If... When you think about it.

583
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:46,629
Because nothing else bad
can happen when she's asleep.

584
00:32:46,655 --> 00:32:48,828
We'll be back to Headquarters
before she wakes up.

585
00:32:48,853 --> 00:32:52,255
We'll just go across
Friendship Island.

586
00:32:53,686 --> 00:32:56,200
- Oh, we'll never make it.
- No-no-no...

587
00:32:56,229 --> 00:32:57,938
Don't obsess over the
way of life's problems

588
00:32:57,963 --> 00:33:00,036
Remember the funny movie
where the dog dies.

589
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:02,571
Oh Sadness.
We don't have time for this.

590
00:33:02,596 --> 00:33:04,456
We'll just have to go around.

591
00:33:04,481 --> 00:33:06,136
Take the scenic route.

592
00:33:06,161 --> 00:33:08,681
Wait.
Joy, you can get lost in there.

593
00:33:08,857 --> 00:33:11,123
- Think positive.
- Okay.

594
00:33:11,148 --> 00:33:14,390
I'm positive you will
get lost in there.

595
00:33:14,415 --> 00:33:16,333
That's long term memory.

596
00:33:16,358 --> 00:33:18,674
An endless swarm of corridors and shelves.

597
00:33:18,699 --> 00:33:21,387
I read about it in the manuals.

598
00:33:21,412 --> 00:33:24,308
The manuals? The manuals.

599
00:33:24,333 --> 00:33:26,081
- You read the manuals.
- Yeah.

600
00:33:26,106 --> 00:33:28,328
So you know the way back
to headquarters.

601
00:33:28,353 --> 00:33:32,605
- I guess.
- Woo-Hnn!

602
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:33,961
You are my map.

603
00:33:33,986 --> 00:33:36,219
Let's go. Lead on, my map.

604
00:33:36,244 --> 00:33:37,391
Show me where we're going.

605
00:33:37,416 --> 00:33:39,386
Okay, only.

606
00:33:39,411 --> 00:33:41,144
I'm too sad to walk.

607
00:33:41,169 --> 00:33:45,671
Just give me a few hours to...

608
00:33:45,907 --> 00:33:48,704
- Which way, left?
- Right.

609
00:33:48,745 --> 00:33:52,275
No, I mean go left.
I said left was right like correct.

610
00:33:52,303 --> 00:33:53,342
Okay.

611
00:33:53,374 --> 00:33:55,646
This actually feels kind of nice.

612
00:33:55,671 --> 00:33:59,490
Okay, here we go. We'll be back
to Headquarters before morning.

613
00:33:59,515 --> 00:34:01,542
We can do it. This will be easy!

614
00:34:01,567 --> 00:34:04,028
This is working.

615
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:07,642
This is not working.

616
00:34:07,675 --> 00:34:11,405
- Are we getting close?
- Yeah. Just another right.

617
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:15,618
And a left.
And then another left.

618
00:34:15,643 --> 00:34:18,536
Are you sure you know
where we're going?

619
00:34:18,561 --> 00:34:21,937
'Cause we seem to be
walking away from Headquarters.

620
00:34:21,962 --> 00:34:24,291
Oh. Riley's awake.

621
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:26,936
Oh. Oh. uh.

622
00:34:28,023 --> 00:34:29,749
Don't. Don't touch, remember?

623
00:34:29,774 --> 00:34:32,356
If you touch them,
they stay sad.

624
00:34:32,381 --> 00:34:34,700
Oh. Sorry. I... I won't.

625
00:34:34,745 --> 00:34:38,333
- Starting now.
- I can't take much more of this.

626
00:34:38,358 --> 00:34:39,905
Forget them!

627
00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:43,590
- Mind workers.
- But, Joy, we're almost oh.

628
00:34:43,615 --> 00:34:45,466
Phone numbers.
We don't need all these.

629
00:34:45,494 --> 00:34:46,466
They're in her phone.

630
00:34:46,491 --> 00:34:47,814
- Just forget all that, please.
- Excuse me. Hi.

631
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:50,076
Forget it.

632
00:34:50,101 --> 00:34:53,307
- I need to find Friendship Island.
- Look at this. 4 years of piano lessons.

633
00:34:53,332 --> 00:34:54,398
Yeah. It looks pretty faded.

634
00:34:54,423 --> 00:34:57,572
You know what. Save Chopsticks and
Heart and Soul, get rid of the rest.

635
00:34:57,826 --> 00:34:59,720
- Are you.
- US presidents. What do you think?

636
00:34:59,745 --> 00:35:01,619
Just keep Washington,
Lincoln and the fat one.

637
00:35:01,644 --> 00:35:02,984
- Forget them!
- Hey!

638
00:35:03,009 --> 00:35:05,540
You can't throw those away.
Those are perfectly good memories.

639
00:35:05,565 --> 00:35:07,963
The names of every
Cutiepie princess doll?

640
00:35:08,007 --> 00:35:09,914
Yes.
That is critical information.

641
00:35:09,939 --> 00:35:12,723
- Glitter storm, Honey pants...
- Forget them.

642
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:19,089
- Hey! Bring those back.
- They're in the Dump.

643
00:35:19,114 --> 00:35:22,411
- Nothing comes back from the Dump.
- Yeah. Look, lady. This is our job, okay.

644
00:35:22,436 --> 00:35:24,619
When Riley doesn't care
about a memory, it fades.

645
00:35:24,644 --> 00:35:26,202
- Fades?
- Happens to the best of them.

646
00:35:26,227 --> 00:35:30,564
Except for this bad boy.
This one will never fade

647
00:35:32,178 --> 00:35:33,644
The song from the
gum commercial?

648
00:35:33,668 --> 00:35:35,908
You know. Sometimes we send that one
up to Headquarters for no reason.

649
00:35:35,934 --> 00:35:40,312
It just plays in Rileys head over
and over again like a million times.

650
00:35:40,337 --> 00:35:42,599
Let's watch it again.

651
00:35:43,126 --> 00:35:46,120
Yeah, I know. We all know the song.
Okay, real catchy.

652
00:35:46,145 --> 00:35:48,559
- Hey. What do you think, should we do it?
- Yeah.

653
00:35:48,584 --> 00:35:52,735
Okay. Here we go! Ha-ha-ha.

654
00:35:54,191 --> 00:35:56,127
What the? This again?

655
00:35:56,152 --> 00:35:57,337
Ha. Great.

656
00:35:57,362 --> 00:36:00,675
Wait! Do you know how to
get to Friendship Island!

657
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:03,364
Do you like it there?
Did you feel any earthquakes?

658
00:36:03,389 --> 00:36:04,553
Is the bridge cool?

659
00:36:04,578 --> 00:36:06,978
Yes. Good.
What happened with the playoffs.

660
00:36:07,003 --> 00:36:10,367
We won the first game. Coach says we
might actually go to the finals this year.

661
00:36:10,392 --> 00:36:13,456
Oh, and we got this new girl
on the team. She's so cool.

662
00:36:13,481 --> 00:36:15,990
- Uh. She did not just say that.
- A new girl?

663
00:36:16,015 --> 00:36:18,201
Mag has a new friend already?

664
00:36:18,226 --> 00:36:19,523
Hey-hey. Stay happy.

665
00:36:19,548 --> 00:36:21,755
We do not want to lose
anymore islands here, guys.

666
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,019
We can pass the puck to each other
without even looking.

667
00:36:24,044 --> 00:36:25,509
It's like mind reading.

668
00:36:25,534 --> 00:36:26,901
You like to read minds, Mag.

669
00:36:26,926 --> 00:36:28,141
- I got something for you to read.
- Anger. What?

670
00:36:28,179 --> 00:36:30,151
- Right here!
- Wait-wait-wait.
Let's just be calm for 1 second.

671
00:36:30,177 --> 00:36:31,591
Aw!

672
00:36:31,818 --> 00:36:33,222
- I got to got.
- What?

673
00:36:33,247 --> 00:36:35,081
I got to go.

674
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,933
Wait. Could you just please
tell me which way is.

675
00:36:38,958 --> 00:36:40,609
Oh no.

676
00:36:43,013 --> 00:36:45,473
Friendship Island. What?

677
00:36:56,678 --> 00:36:58,776
Not Friendship.

678
00:37:03,673 --> 00:37:08,634
Oh, Riley love that one.
And now it's gone.

679
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:12,829
Goodbye Friendship
Hello Loneliness.

680
00:37:16,057 --> 00:37:18,765
We'll just have to go the long way.

681
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:24,527
Yeah. The long long long... way.

682
00:37:24,552 --> 00:37:26,569
I'm ready.

683
00:37:27,343 --> 00:37:30,279
There's got to be a better way.

684
00:37:31,511 --> 00:37:34,401
- Woo. Well look at you.
- Huh?

685
00:37:34,426 --> 00:37:37,129
I will take you but not you.

686
00:37:37,154 --> 00:37:39,563
Ah! Who am I kidding.
I can't leave you.

687
00:37:39,595 --> 00:37:40,938
Hello!

688
00:37:40,963 --> 00:37:43,452
- Aw.
- Wait. Hey, wait.

689
00:37:44,897 --> 00:37:46,778
No, wait. Stop.

690
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:57,021
- Excuse me.
- Aw!

691
00:37:58,046 --> 00:37:59,881
Oh. I was, I was looking for

692
00:37:59,906 --> 00:38:01,202
- diversion!
- What?

693
00:38:01,227 --> 00:38:03,725
Ha ha! So long, sucker.

694
00:38:04,283 --> 00:38:05,492
Ou. I'm hurt all over.

695
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:07,155
Wait, I know you.

696
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,575
No, you don't. I get that a lot.

697
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,479
- I look like a lot of people.
- No no no... I do.

698
00:38:12,504 --> 00:38:15,277
Bing Bong,
Riley's imaginary friend.

699
00:38:15,302 --> 00:38:17,765
- You really do know me?
- Of course.

700
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:20,462
Riley loved playings with you.
You two were best friends.

701
00:38:20,487 --> 00:38:21,836
Oh, oh. You wouldn't know.

702
00:38:21,861 --> 00:38:24,028
- We're trying to get back to Headquarters.
- Headquarters?

703
00:38:24,053 --> 00:38:26,682
- You guys are from Headquarters?
- Well, yeah.

704
00:38:26,707 --> 00:38:28,196
I'm Joy. This is Sadness.

705
00:38:28,221 --> 00:38:30,254
- You're Joy, the Joy?
- Uh-huh.

706
00:38:30,279 --> 00:38:31,896
What the heck
are you doing out here?

707
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,695
That's a good question.
You want to answer that, Sadness?

708
00:38:34,721 --> 00:38:37,455
Without you,
I won't ever be happy.

709
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,483
We can't have that.
We got to get you back.

710
00:38:39,508 --> 00:38:41,532
I'll tell you what. Follow me.

711
00:38:41,707 --> 00:38:44,305
Thank you. It is
so great to see you again.

712
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:46,785
I got to tell you.
I'm such a huge fan of your work.

713
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:49,251
Do you remember when
you and Riley were in a band?

714
00:38:49,276 --> 00:38:51,659
Ha-ha-ha.
I went to all of your concerts.

715
00:38:51,684 --> 00:38:53,095
Yeah. I blow a mean nose.

716
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,987
- Watching you play tag was such a treat.
- 2 time room champ.

717
00:38:56,012 --> 00:39:00,265
- Oh, and remember your rockets.
- Of course, it runs on song power.

718
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:01,727
That's right. Your theme song.

719
00:39:01,758 --> 00:39:04,409
- Who's your friend who likes to play?
- Bing Bong. Bing Bong.

720
00:39:04,434 --> 00:39:07,912
- His rocket makes you yell "Hooray!"
- Bing Bong. Bing Bong.

721
00:39:07,937 --> 00:39:10,275
What exactly are you
suppose to be?

722
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:13,307
You know what's unclear?
I'm mostly cotton candy. But.

723
00:39:13,338 --> 00:39:17,887
Shape wise. I'm part cat,
part elephant, part dolphin.

724
00:39:17,912 --> 00:39:19,539
Dolphin?

725
00:39:21,756 --> 00:39:24,796
You got to remember. When Riley
was 3, animals were all her age.

726
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:26,725
The cow goes moo.
The horse goes neigh.

727
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:28,207
It's all the people
talked back then.

728
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:29,815
Yeah, yeah. I guess that true.

729
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,271
- What are you doing out here?
- Well.

730
00:39:31,296 --> 00:39:34,490
There's not much call for
imaginary friends lately.

731
00:39:34,515 --> 00:39:38,280
So, I. You know...

732
00:39:38,578 --> 00:39:41,002
Yeah, yeah, Don't be sad.

733
00:39:41,027 --> 00:39:43,103
Tell you what.
When I get back up to Headquarters.

734
00:39:43,128 --> 00:39:45,415
I'll make sure Riley remembers you.

735
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,845
- You will?
- Of course. She loved that.

736
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:51,903
Ha-ha!
This is the greatest day of my life.

737
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:55,156
Aw aw aw...

738
00:39:55,437 --> 00:39:58,241
- Are you okay?
- Hey, what's going on?

739
00:39:58,266 --> 00:39:59,600
I cry candy.

740
00:39:59,625 --> 00:40:02,336
- Try the caramel, it's delicious.
- Woo.

741
00:40:02,361 --> 00:40:03,787
- Whoa!
- Woo.

742
00:40:03,812 --> 00:40:05,385
- Here use this.
- Thanks.

743
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:07,413
Oh, hold on. Wait a second.

744
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:12,933
It always get stuck
at the bottom.

745
00:40:14,708 --> 00:40:16,177
Here.

746
00:40:16,208 --> 00:40:17,919
What? It's imaginary.

747
00:40:17,944 --> 00:40:20,908
Thanks. This will make it a lot easier
to walk back to Headquarters.

748
00:40:20,933 --> 00:40:22,594
Walk? We're not walking.

749
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:26,234
We're taking the Train of Thought.

750
00:40:26,533 --> 00:40:28,384
The Train. Of course.

751
00:40:28,409 --> 00:40:31,030
That is so much fast.
But how do we catch it.

752
00:40:31,055 --> 00:40:35,499
Well, it kind of go all over the place
but there is a station in Imagination Land.

753
00:40:35,524 --> 00:40:38,103
I know a shortcut.
Come on, this way.

754
00:40:38,128 --> 00:40:40,810
Oh. I'm so glad we ran into you.

755
00:40:40,835 --> 00:40:43,627
The station is right in here.
After you.

756
00:40:43,652 --> 00:40:45,132
- Joy.
- What?

757
00:40:45,157 --> 00:40:48,405
Well. I read about this place in the
manual. We shouldn't go in there.

758
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:50,347
Bing Bong says it's the
quickest way to Headquarters.

759
00:40:50,378 --> 00:40:52,582
No. But Joy,
this is abstract thought.

760
00:40:52,607 --> 00:40:54,943
What are you talking about?
I go in here all the time.

761
00:40:54,968 --> 00:40:56,728
It's a shortcut. You see.

762
00:40:56,759 --> 00:40:59,420
[DANGER - KEEP OUT!]
D A N G E R. Shortcut.

763
00:40:59,445 --> 00:41:01,251
I'll prove it to you.

764
00:41:01,464 --> 00:41:02,772
Look at me.

765
00:41:02,797 --> 00:41:06,838
I'm crossing into the station.
'Cause I'm taking the shortcut.

766
00:41:06,863 --> 00:41:08,687
Let's. Let's go around.
This way.

767
00:41:08,712 --> 00:41:11,110
Almost there.

768
00:41:11,361 --> 00:41:13,877
If you want to walk
the long way, go for it.

769
00:41:13,902 --> 00:41:17,601
But Riley needs to be happy.
I'm not missing that Train.

770
00:41:17,626 --> 00:41:21,083
Bing Bong knows what he is doing.
He's part dolphin, they're very smart.

771
00:41:21,108 --> 00:41:23,611
Well, I guess.

772
00:41:41,459 --> 00:41:45,426
Okay. What abstract concept are we
trying to comprehend today.

773
00:41:45,451 --> 00:41:47,009
- Loneliness.
- Hm.

774
00:41:47,034 --> 00:41:48,671
I think there is
something in there.

775
00:41:48,702 --> 00:41:51,266
I'm going to turn it on for a minute
and burn out the dumb thoughts.

776
00:41:51,291 --> 00:41:54,299
What did I tell ya.
You'll be in Headquarters in no time.

777
00:41:55,088 --> 00:41:57,062
Hey, will you look at that?

778
00:41:57,087 --> 00:42:00,182
- Whoa. What's happening?
- Oh no, they turned it on.

779
00:42:00,207 --> 00:42:02,893
Oh. Never seen this before.

780
00:42:05,041 --> 00:42:08,307
My face. My beautiful face.
Whoa!

781
00:42:08,332 --> 00:42:10,128
- What is going on?
- We're abstracting.

782
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:12,198
There are 4 stages.
This is the first.

783
00:42:12,223 --> 00:42:14,176
Nonobjective fragmentation.

784
00:42:14,201 --> 00:42:18,282
Alright, do not panic. What's
important is that we all stay together.

785
00:42:18,307 --> 00:42:19,313
- Oh.
- Aw.

786
00:42:19,338 --> 00:42:22,078
We're in the second stage.
We're deconstructing.

787
00:42:22,103 --> 00:42:23,693
Run!

788
00:42:23,718 --> 00:42:27,081
Aw. I can't feel my legs.

789
00:42:27,106 --> 00:42:29,847
- Oh, there they are.
- Come here, me.

790
00:42:31,114 --> 00:42:35,058
We got to get out of here.
Before we're not even shape and color

791
00:42:35,083 --> 00:42:36,823
We'll get stuck here forever

792
00:42:36,848 --> 00:42:38,544
Bong. Why did we come in here?

793
00:42:38,569 --> 00:42:41,455
I told you. It's a shortcut.

794
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,053
The Train.

795
00:42:46,783 --> 00:42:50,488
Oh no. We're 2 dimensional.
That's stage 3.

796
00:42:50,513 --> 00:42:53,181
- We're getting no where.
- Death. Unlucky death.

797
00:42:53,206 --> 00:42:54,764
Come on.

798
00:42:57,525 --> 00:42:59,219
We can't fit.

799
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:02,826
Oh no, we're not figurative
This is the last stage.

800
00:43:02,851 --> 00:43:04,952
We're not gonna make it.

801
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:10,675
Wait, we're 2 dimensional.
Fall on your face.

802
00:43:20,768 --> 00:43:23,652
Stop. Stop!

803
00:43:24,951 --> 00:43:27,158
No.
You said that was a shortcut.

804
00:43:27,228 --> 00:43:30,284
I did. But wow,
we should not had gone in there.

805
00:43:30,309 --> 00:43:32,552
That was dangerous.
They should really put up a sign.

806
00:43:32,577 --> 00:43:34,822
- How long till the next Train?
- Who knows?

807
00:43:34,847 --> 00:43:37,405
But don't worry.
There's another station. That way.

808
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:40,688
The Train always stops there,
right before it goes to Headquarters.

809
00:43:40,713 --> 00:43:42,712
If we hurry, we can catch it.

810
00:43:42,737 --> 00:43:44,926
This isn't another one
of your shortcuts, is it?

811
00:43:44,951 --> 00:43:47,566
Ha-ha-ha. Yeah.

812
00:43:47,591 --> 00:43:51,290
- Is there really another station?
- Uh-huh. Through there.

813
00:43:52,756 --> 00:43:57,265
- Welcome to Imagination Land.
- Imagination Land?

814
00:43:57,290 --> 00:43:59,956
Sure. I come here all the time.
I'm practically the mayor.

815
00:43:59,993 --> 00:44:03,625
Hey, you guys hungry?
There's French Fries Forest.

816
00:44:03,826 --> 00:44:05,814
No way! Ha-ha-ha.

817
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:08,147
Check it out. Trophy Town.

818
00:44:08,174 --> 00:44:11,916
Medals, Ribbons.
Everyone's a winner.

819
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:13,547
I won first prize.

820
00:44:13,572 --> 00:44:16,594
- Me too!
- Oh. Participation award.

821
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:18,517
Wait, is that? Is that a? Look.

822
00:44:18,542 --> 00:44:20,212
It's Cloud Town.

823
00:44:20,237 --> 00:44:22,119
That's my favorite. Hoo-hoo-hoo.

824
00:44:22,144 --> 00:44:25,063
- Oh, it's so soft.
- Oh oh oh. Let me try.

825
00:44:25,088 --> 00:44:27,160
Hey! What the big idea?

826
00:44:27,185 --> 00:44:30,939
You better fix that wall or else
you're in big trouble.

827
00:44:31,829 --> 00:44:34,936
Oh no, lava. Woo. Whoa.

828
00:44:34,961 --> 00:44:37,911
Imagination Land is the best.

829
00:44:38,135 --> 00:44:40,972
Oh, is it all going
to be so interactive.

830
00:44:40,997 --> 00:44:43,182
Hey look! The House of Cards.

831
00:44:43,207 --> 00:44:45,818
Woo wait. Hang on just a minute.

832
00:44:45,843 --> 00:44:47,150
- Your rocket.
- Yeah.

833
00:44:47,175 --> 00:44:48,990
I stashed it in there
for safekeeping.

834
00:44:49,015 --> 00:44:52,507
And now I'm all set
to take Riley to the moon!

835
00:44:52,532 --> 00:44:54,553
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Great.

836
00:44:54,578 --> 00:44:57,553
- Whoa. I love Imagination Land.
- Isn't it great?

837
00:44:57,578 --> 00:44:59,928
And there's always
something new like...

838
00:45:02,196 --> 00:45:05,066
- Who the heck is that?
- Imaginary boyfriend.

839
00:45:05,091 --> 00:45:07,367
- I would die for Riley.
- Whoa.

840
00:45:07,392 --> 00:45:10,427
- I've never seen him before.
- I live in Canada.

841
00:45:10,452 --> 00:45:14,245
Anyway. Through Preschool World.
We're nearly to the train.

842
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:17,825
Riley, here we come.
Woo-Hoo. Ha-ha-ha.

843
00:45:18,234 --> 00:45:21,961
This should be fun.
New team. New friends.

844
00:45:21,986 --> 00:45:23,361
There kids looked pretty good.

845
00:45:23,386 --> 00:45:26,381
Considering they're from
San Francisco. Heh-heh-heh.

846
00:45:26,406 --> 00:45:29,472
- Got to go.
- Okay. Good luck, sweetie.

847
00:45:29,501 --> 00:45:32,588
Look, kissing isn't going to help us now. If she
tries to use Hockey Island. It's going down.

848
00:45:32,613 --> 00:45:36,254
Which is why, I recalled
every hockey memory I can think of.

849
00:45:36,279 --> 00:45:38,851
One of these is got to work
in place of a core memory.

850
00:45:38,876 --> 00:45:41,562
- She's about to play.
- Hurry.

851
00:45:47,129 --> 00:45:50,700
Ha ha. We did it gang.
It's working.

852
00:45:50,725 --> 00:45:52,233
Oh.

853
00:46:02,262 --> 00:46:05,078
Hahaha. No-no-no... Aw!

854
00:46:09,616 --> 00:46:12,019
It's like we don't learn anything.

855
00:46:18,232 --> 00:46:19,461
- That's it.
- No no no.

856
00:46:19,486 --> 00:46:21,309
Free on your happy place.

857
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:23,931
Aw!

858
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:35,404
- Riley, what's wrong?
- Let's go.

859
00:46:35,429 --> 00:46:37,570
- You're not going to finish try outs?
- What's the point?

860
00:46:37,595 --> 00:46:39,719
Hey. It will be alright.

861
00:46:39,744 --> 00:46:42,887
- Let's just go back.
- Stop saying everything will be alright.

862
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:56,242
Hockey!

863
00:46:58,165 --> 00:47:00,835
Oh no no. She loves hockey.

864
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:03,340
She can't give up hockey.

865
00:47:05,161 --> 00:47:06,827
Bing Bong,
we have to get to that station.

866
00:47:06,852 --> 00:47:09,327
Sure thing. This way,
just past Grand Cracker Castle.

867
00:47:09,352 --> 00:47:11,070
Hey. That's weird.

868
00:47:11,095 --> 00:47:14,302
Grand Cracker Castle used to be right here.
I wonder why they moved it.

869
00:47:15,089 --> 00:47:17,621
I would have sworn
Sparkle Pointy Mountain was right here.

870
00:47:17,646 --> 00:47:19,240
- Hey, what's going on?
- Yeah yeah. I don't know.

871
00:47:19,265 --> 00:47:22,301
- We'll have to come back.
- Princess Dreamworld

872
00:47:23,938 --> 00:47:27,534
Oh,
The Stuffed Animal Hall of Fame.

873
00:47:28,708 --> 00:47:30,238
My rocket?

874
00:47:30,263 --> 00:47:33,185
Wait.
Riley and I were still using that rocket.

875
00:47:33,337 --> 00:47:35,123
It still has some song power left.

876
00:47:35,148 --> 00:47:37,546
Who's your friend
who likes to play?

877
00:47:42,961 --> 00:47:44,963
No! No no.

878
00:47:44,988 --> 00:47:49,277
You can't take my rocket to the Dump.
Riley and I are going to the moon.

879
00:47:54,167 --> 00:47:57,020
Riley can't be done with me?

880
00:48:02,414 --> 00:48:05,970
Hey, it's going to be okay.
We can fix this.

881
00:48:05,995 --> 00:48:09,408
We just need to get back to Headquarters.
Which way to the Train station?

882
00:48:09,433 --> 00:48:12,898
I had a whole trip
planned for us.

883
00:48:13,179 --> 00:48:18,548
Hey, who's ticklish.
Here comes the tickle monster.

884
00:48:19,274 --> 00:48:21,201
Hey. Bing Bong, look at this.

885
00:48:23,709 --> 00:48:26,428
Oh, here's a fun game.
You point to the Train station

886
00:48:26,453 --> 00:48:30,222
and we all go there.
Won't that be fun?

887
00:48:30,247 --> 00:48:32,872
Come on,
let's go to the Train station.

888
00:48:34,122 --> 00:48:36,801
I'm sorry they took your rocket.

889
00:48:36,864 --> 00:48:41,473
They took something that you loved.
It's gone, forever.

890
00:48:41,498 --> 00:48:44,593
- Sadness, don't make him feel worse.
- Sorry.

891
00:48:44,618 --> 00:48:47,055
It's all I had left with Riley.

892
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:49,979
I bet you and Riley
had great adventures.

893
00:48:50,004 --> 00:48:52,052
Oh, they were wonderful.

894
00:48:52,077 --> 00:48:56,137
Once, we flew back in time.
We had breakfast twice that day.

895
00:48:56,162 --> 00:49:00,221
- Sadness.
- It sounds amazing. I bet Riley liked it.

896
00:49:00,246 --> 00:49:04,494
Oh, she did.
We were best friends.

897
00:49:04,519 --> 00:49:07,473
Yeah. Yeah.

898
00:49:12,173 --> 00:49:13,729
What?

899
00:49:19,046 --> 00:49:20,823
I'm okay now.

900
00:49:21,936 --> 00:49:25,651
Come on.
The Train station is this way.

901
00:49:31,297 --> 00:49:33,568
- How did you do that?
- Oh, I don't know.

902
00:49:33,593 --> 00:49:36,917
- I feel sad so I listen to what...
- Hey!

903
00:49:36,942 --> 00:49:39,113
There's the Train.

904
00:49:49,048 --> 00:49:53,827
Oh, we made it. We're
finally going to get home.

905
00:49:53,852 --> 00:49:57,611
Oh no.
These facts and opinions look so similar.

906
00:49:57,636 --> 00:50:00,708
Don't worry about it.
Happens all the time.

907
00:50:04,221 --> 00:50:07,035
On a scale of 1 to 10.
I give this day an 'F'.

908
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:09,934
Well, why don't we quit standing
around and do something.

909
00:50:09,959 --> 00:50:13,243
- Like what, genius?
- Like quitting. That's what I'm doing.

910
00:50:13,268 --> 00:50:18,368
Sure. It's the coward's way out.
But this coward is gonna survive.

911
00:50:25,091 --> 00:50:27,396
Emotions can't quit, genius.

912
00:50:27,995 --> 00:50:31,269
Ewg. I thought we're
suppose to keep Riley happy

913
00:50:31,298 --> 00:50:33,806
Wait a minute. Wait a minute!

914
00:50:36,189 --> 00:50:38,713
Uh-huh! H0 ho ho...

915
00:50:38,738 --> 00:50:40,325
- What is it?
- Oh nothing.

916
00:50:40,350 --> 00:50:42,588
- Just the best idea ever.
- What?

917
00:50:42,613 --> 00:50:45,321
All the good core memories
were made in Minnesota.

918
00:50:45,346 --> 00:50:48,436
Ergo, we go back to Minnesota
and make more.

919
00:50:48,461 --> 00:50:49,596
- Ta-dah.
- Wait wait wait.

920
00:50:49,621 --> 00:50:51,607
You're say we run away?

921
00:50:51,632 --> 00:50:53,026
Well, I wouldn't call it that.

922
00:50:53,051 --> 00:50:55,861
I call it the 'Happy core
memory development program'.

923
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:58,466
- You can't be serious.
- Hey, our life was perfect.

924
00:50:58,491 --> 00:51:02,703
Until Mon and Dad decided to
move to San Fran stincko.

925
00:51:02,728 --> 00:51:04,729
But, I mean.
It's just so drastic.

926
00:51:04,754 --> 00:51:07,245
Need I remind you of how
great things were there.

927
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:11,031
Our room. Our backyard.
Our friends.

928
00:51:13,302 --> 00:51:15,751
Did I ask for the gum commercial?

929
00:51:15,776 --> 00:51:17,310
Anyway, it was better.
That's my point.

930
00:51:17,335 --> 00:51:20,730
- Yeah, Riley was happier in Minnesota.
- Wait. Hold on.

931
00:51:20,755 --> 00:51:22,415
Should we just sleep
on this or something?

932
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:23,925
Fine, let's sleep on it.

933
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:30,204
But, hey. I'm sure joyly fun-filled
times are just around the corner.

934
00:51:35,932 --> 00:51:37,251
Huh?

935
00:51:41,329 --> 00:51:42,960
Hey hey. Why aren't we moving?

936
00:51:42,985 --> 00:51:45,447
Riley's gone to sleep.
We're all on break.

937
00:51:45,472 --> 00:51:47,298
You mean we're stuck
here until morning?

938
00:51:47,323 --> 00:51:49,423
Yeah. The Train of Thought
doesn't run while she's asleep.

939
00:51:49,452 --> 00:51:52,120
- Oh, we can't wait that long.
- How about we wake her up.

940
00:51:52,145 --> 00:51:55,806
Sadness, that's ridiculous.
How can we possibly...

941
00:51:57,308 --> 00:51:59,626
- How about we wake her up.
- Great idea Joy.

942
00:51:59,651 --> 00:52:01,183
Thanks, come on.

943
00:52:01,208 --> 00:52:03,214
<font color="#ffff8c">PRODUCTION OF Dreams</font>

944
00:52:05,570 --> 00:52:07,935
Whoa. This place is huge.

945
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,851
It looks so much smaller
than I expected.

946
00:52:10,876 --> 00:52:15,435
Wow, I can fly. I love that one.

947
00:52:15,956 --> 00:52:18,696
Rainbow Unicorn.
She's right there.

948
00:52:21,086 --> 00:52:23,007
My friend says you're famous.

949
00:52:23,032 --> 00:52:24,935
- She wants your autograph.
- No no, Sadness.

950
00:52:24,964 --> 00:52:26,847
Don't bother Miss. Unicorn, okay?

951
00:52:26,876 --> 00:52:30,711
Sorry she's from out of town.
It's so embarrassing, right?

952
00:52:31,203 --> 00:52:35,257
I love you in Fairy Dream Adventure part 7.
Okay bye. I love you.

953
00:52:35,301 --> 00:52:36,512
<font color="#ffbbdd">[NO ENTRY WHEN THE LIGHT IS ON]</font>

954
00:52:36,537 --> 00:52:40,249
Huh! Wonder what that means?
Oh well, let's go in.

955
00:52:41,632 --> 00:52:43,297
Set up the classroom set.

956
00:52:43,322 --> 00:52:46,273
Today's memories are in.
We've got a lot to work with here.

957
00:52:46,298 --> 00:52:50,437
Riley dumped her best friend, had a
miserable day at school and quit hockey.

958
00:52:50,462 --> 00:52:53,001
The writers had put
together a killer script.

959
00:52:53,032 --> 00:52:57,424
Just because Joy and Sadness are gone,
I have the stupid dream duty.

960
00:52:58,237 --> 00:53:00,142
Okay. How are we
going to wake her up?

961
00:53:00,173 --> 00:53:03,155
Well. She wakes up sometimes
when she has a scary dream.

962
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,899
- We could scare her.
- Scare her?

963
00:53:04,924 --> 00:53:07,253
- No no. She's been though enough already.
- But, Joy.

964
00:53:07,278 --> 00:53:08,776
Sadness, you may know your
way around down here.

965
00:53:08,801 --> 00:53:10,211
But I know Riley.

966
00:53:10,236 --> 00:53:13,706
We're gonna make her so happy,
she'll wake up with exhilaration

967
00:53:13,731 --> 00:53:17,344
- We'll excite her awake.
- That's never happen before.

968
00:53:17,369 --> 00:53:19,140
Woo, Riley loves dogs.
Put this on.

969
00:53:19,165 --> 00:53:20,261
I don't think that will work.

970
00:53:20,286 --> 00:53:21,807
- Bing Bong.
- Yeah.

971
00:53:21,852 --> 00:53:25,716
- Don't let anything happen to these.
- Got it.

972
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:29,349
Uh-huh.
Add the reality distortion filter.

973
00:53:30,456 --> 00:53:33,143
Love it. Remember, play
to the camera everyone.

974
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:35,492
Riley is the camera.
Make them get out of there.

975
00:53:35,517 --> 00:53:39,452
We are on in 543...

976
00:53:40,493 --> 00:53:45,891
Hello class.
Before we begin today's pop quiz...

977
00:53:45,916 --> 00:53:48,840
And she is one bad actress

978
00:53:50,444 --> 00:53:53,842
I want to introduce our new student.

979
00:53:53,867 --> 00:53:56,972
Riley. Would you like
to stand up and introduce

980
00:53:57,159 --> 00:53:59,428
- Camera.
- Yourself.

981
00:53:59,789 --> 00:54:01,861
And, to Riley.

982
00:54:01,886 --> 00:54:03,455
My name is Riley Anderson.

983
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:06,987
I'm from Minnesota
and now I live here.

984
00:54:07,012 --> 00:54:09,832
Ew. Look, her teeth
are falling out.

985
00:54:10,764 --> 00:54:11,810
Ew, gross.

986
00:54:11,835 --> 00:54:15,323
Teeth falling out.
Yeah, I'm used to that one.

987
00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:17,574
Let me guess. We've no pants on.

988
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:19,843
Hey, look. She came to
school with no pants on.

989
00:54:19,868 --> 00:54:21,432
Called it!

990
00:54:21,457 --> 00:54:24,130
- Ready?
- I don't think this happy thing is going to work.

991
00:54:24,155 --> 00:54:26,409
- But if we scare her.
- Just follow my lead.

992
00:54:26,434 --> 00:54:27,829
Here we go.

993
00:54:27,854 --> 00:54:30,788
Aruu. Bark-bark-bark.

994
00:54:30,813 --> 00:54:34,175
- Who is that?
- What's going on?

995
00:54:39,377 --> 00:54:41,770
Psst, you're on. Go.

996
00:54:41,795 --> 00:54:45,388
Woo. Let's party.
Let's dance. Woo.

997
00:54:45,413 --> 00:54:47,554
Hey. A party.

998
00:54:48,042 --> 00:54:49,131
Bark-bark-bark.

999
00:54:49,156 --> 00:54:52,199
Joy, this is not working.

1000
00:54:52,983 --> 00:54:54,409
No.

1001
00:54:57,190 --> 00:54:57,996
Huh.

1002
00:54:58,021 --> 00:55:00,781
Huh. Sadness, what are you doing?
Come back here.

1003
00:55:02,089 --> 00:55:05,143
It's just a dream. It's just a dream.
It's just a dream.

1004
00:55:06,048 --> 00:55:09,473
They're trying to wake her up.
Call security.

1005
00:55:09,821 --> 00:55:13,087
- Hi Riley, it's me.
- Bing Bong?

1006
00:55:17,613 --> 00:55:19,334
Sadness.
You are ruining this dream.

1007
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:21,844
- You're scaring her.
- But look. It's working.

1008
00:55:22,362 --> 00:55:23,256
Whoa.

1009
00:55:23,281 --> 00:55:25,829
They're not part of this dream.
Get them.

1010
00:55:25,854 --> 00:55:27,721
Stop right there!

1011
00:55:28,949 --> 00:55:31,006
Pan away. Pan away.

1012
00:55:34,244 --> 00:55:36,703
Boo. Peek and Poke line.

1013
00:55:36,728 --> 00:55:38,433
Aw, careful.

1014
00:55:38,458 --> 00:55:42,820
You can't do this.
I know people in Headquarters.

1015
00:55:51,012 --> 00:55:53,775
No-no-no...

1016
00:55:53,851 --> 00:55:56,140
There go the core memories.

1017
00:55:58,904 --> 00:56:00,374
Come on.

1018
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:04,222
- What is this place?
- The subconscious.

1019
00:56:04,254 --> 00:56:07,420
That's where they take
all the troublemakers.

1020
00:56:11,494 --> 00:56:12,826
My hat feels loose.

1021
00:56:12,851 --> 00:56:14,663
How do we get in?

1022
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:18,310
- Is that your hat?
- Yeah, it's my hat.

1023
00:56:18,335 --> 00:56:20,342
You sure, I don't know.
Look at the label.

1024
00:56:20,367 --> 00:56:21,440
Yeah, it says my hat.

1025
00:56:22,465 --> 00:56:24,553
- Wait. It says my hat?
- My hat, it says.

1026
00:56:24,578 --> 00:56:26,268
- That's what I wrote in my hat.
- What are you talking about?

1027
00:56:26,293 --> 00:56:29,043
- Look. You got my hat on.
- Okay, it's my hat.

1028
00:56:29,102 --> 00:56:31,964
- Hey you.
- Oh, you caught us.

1029
00:56:32,364 --> 00:56:35,526
Get back in there. No escaping.

1030
00:56:39,212 --> 00:56:40,705
Oh.

1031
00:56:44,307 --> 00:56:49,372
I don't like it here. It's where
they keep Riley's darkest fears.

1032
00:56:50,962 --> 00:56:53,358
It's broccoli.

1033
00:56:55,212 --> 00:56:57,646
The stairs to the biggest smite.

1034
00:56:59,084 --> 00:57:02,744
Grandma's vacuum cleaner. Aw!

1035
00:57:09,407 --> 00:57:11,633
Okay, come on.

1036
00:57:12,577 --> 00:57:15,215
- Would you walk quieter.
- I'm trying.

1037
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:16,961
What is going...

1038
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:20,277
Candy wrappers.

1039
00:57:30,378 --> 00:57:32,682
- Bing Bong.
- Joy?

1040
00:57:32,707 --> 00:57:35,650
- There you are.
- Shh.

1041
00:57:39,722 --> 00:57:42,794
Who's the person...

1042
00:57:55,742 --> 00:57:58,638
- Do you have the core memories?
- Yeah.

1043
00:57:58,663 --> 00:58:01,771
All he cared about
was the candy.

1044
00:58:02,214 --> 00:58:03,695
Shh.

1045
00:58:18,459 --> 00:58:21,539
We're outta here.
Let's get to that Train.

1046
00:58:21,564 --> 00:58:25,544
Wait. The Train is not running.
We still have to wake up Riley.

1047
00:58:25,569 --> 00:58:27,420
But how?

1048
00:58:30,066 --> 00:58:31,704
Oh no.

1049
00:58:48,724 --> 00:58:53,499
Hey Sadness. Did you hear
about the party they were having.

1050
00:58:53,524 --> 00:58:58,060
Yeah, yes Joy.
Isn't it a bir-bir-birthday party?

1051
00:58:58,085 --> 00:59:01,334
Did you say birthday?

1052
00:59:01,359 --> 00:59:04,426
- And there's going to be cake and presents.
- And games and balloons.

1053
00:59:04,451 --> 00:59:06,150
A BIRTHDAY!

1054
00:59:06,175 --> 00:59:08,496
Okay. Follow us.

1055
00:59:09,868 --> 00:59:12,017
Nothing like a good scare
to wake you up, right?

1056
00:59:12,042 --> 00:59:13,612
- Okay, it's my hand writing.
- No, it isn't.

1057
00:59:13,637 --> 00:59:16,896
- It's my hat. I wrote that.
- No, this one's my hat.

1058
00:59:35,253 --> 00:59:38,945
- Who's the birthday girl?
- Aw!

1059
00:59:42,170 --> 00:59:44,887
- Woo-hoo.
- Come on, let's go.

1060
00:59:50,975 --> 00:59:53,590
- Ha ha. We made it.
- Ha ha.

1061
00:59:53,615 --> 00:59:57,730
- Guess who's on their way to Headquarters.
- We are.

1062
01:00:04,055 --> 01:00:06,717
- What is going on?
- He did it again.

1063
01:00:06,742 --> 01:00:09,326
We were at school. And we were naked.
And there was a dog.

1064
01:00:09,357 --> 01:00:11,811
The back half was...
It was-It was chasing it, I mean.

1065
01:00:11,836 --> 01:00:14,672
- There was a Bing Bong.
- You idiot. It was a dream.

1066
01:00:14,697 --> 01:00:18,758
This is ridiculous. We can't even
get a good night sleep anymore.

1067
01:00:18,783 --> 01:00:20,648
Time to take action.

1068
01:00:20,771 --> 01:00:22,840
Stupid Mon and Dad.
If they hadn't move us

1069
01:00:22,865 --> 01:00:24,671
none of this would have happen.

1070
01:00:24,696 --> 01:00:26,479
Who's with me?

1071
01:00:29,969 --> 01:00:32,009
Yeah. Let's do it.

1072
01:00:43,551 --> 01:00:45,951
She took it.
There's no turning back.

1073
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:48,557
So. How are we going to
get to Minnesota from here.

1074
01:00:48,582 --> 01:00:51,646
Well. Why don't we go down to the
elephant lot and rent an elephant.

1075
01:00:51,671 --> 01:00:53,035
Hey, that sounds nice.

1076
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:55,713
We're taking the bus, nitwit!

1077
01:00:56,696 --> 01:00:58,715
There is a bus leaving
tomorrow, perfect.

1078
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:01,159
A ticket cost money.
How do we get money?

1079
01:01:01,184 --> 01:01:03,169
- Mom's purse.
- Oh. You wouldn't.

1080
01:01:03,194 --> 01:01:06,922
Oh, but I would.
Where was it we saw it last?

1081
01:01:08,476 --> 01:01:09,865
- No!
- Aw!

1082
01:01:09,890 --> 01:01:11,342
It's downstairs somewhere.

1083
01:01:11,367 --> 01:01:15,273
Mom and Dad got us into this mess.
They can pay to get us out.

1084
01:01:17,626 --> 01:01:19,618
How about this...
Isn't this nice?

1085
01:01:19,643 --> 01:01:21,625
You can see everything
from up here.

1086
01:01:21,650 --> 01:01:25,054
Look. There's Inductive Reasoning.
There's Deja Vu.

1087
01:01:25,079 --> 01:01:27,851
There's Language Processing.
There's Deja Vu.

1088
01:01:27,876 --> 01:01:30,764
There's Critical Thinking.
There's Deja Vu.

1089
01:01:30,789 --> 01:01:33,040
And look at this guy's memories.

1090
01:01:33,796 --> 01:01:36,207
Hey. That was a good idea.

1091
01:01:36,232 --> 01:01:38,440
About scaring Riley awake.

1092
01:01:38,465 --> 01:01:41,775
- You're not so bad.
- Really?

1093
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,362
Nice work.

1094
01:01:44,288 --> 01:01:46,289
I can't wait to get
the old Riley back.

1095
01:01:46,314 --> 01:01:49,279
As soon as we get there,
I'm going to fix this whole mess.

1096
01:01:49,304 --> 01:01:51,053
Whoa. Is this Riley?

1097
01:01:51,078 --> 01:01:53,472
She's so big now.
She won't fit in my rocket.

1098
01:01:53,497 --> 01:01:54,914
How're we gonna get to the moon.

1099
01:01:54,939 --> 01:01:57,859
Oh. It's that time in the
Twistee Treat, remember?

1100
01:01:57,884 --> 01:02:01,960
The hockey team showed up and
Mon and Dad were there cheering.

1101
01:02:01,985 --> 01:02:05,250
Look at her.
Having fun and laughing.

1102
01:02:05,498 --> 01:02:09,306
- I love this one.
- I love that one too.

1103
01:02:09,331 --> 01:02:12,197
- Atta girl. Now you're getting it.
- Yeah.

1104
01:02:12,222 --> 01:02:15,684
It was the day the Prairie dogs
lost the big playoff game.

1105
01:02:15,709 --> 01:02:20,651
Riley missed the winning shot.
She felt awful, she wanted to quit.

1106
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:24,926
Sorry.
I went sad again, didn't I?

1107
01:02:25,170 --> 01:02:29,185
I'll tell you what. We can keep working
on that when we get back, okay?

1108
01:02:29,210 --> 01:02:30,948
Okay.

1109
01:02:32,296 --> 01:02:34,498
I just don't understand.

1110
01:02:36,226 --> 01:02:39,161
Why did our moving van
even go to Texas?

1111
01:02:43,249 --> 01:02:45,223
Multiple customer.

1112
01:02:51,630 --> 01:02:54,911
Well, we were promised
delivery on the 5th.

1113
01:02:57,911 --> 01:02:59,499
Uh-huh.

1114
01:03:04,468 --> 01:03:08,135
Excuse me. Isn't there any way
you think you can even rush it.

1115
01:03:12,669 --> 01:03:14,571
Honesty Island?

1116
01:03:22,943 --> 01:03:24,358
Look out!

1117
01:03:24,383 --> 01:03:26,084
Aw!

1118
01:03:29,677 --> 01:03:31,201
Come on!

1119
01:03:35,426 --> 01:03:36,935
Hold on!

1120
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:39,068
- Hurry up.
- Join over here.

1121
01:03:39,477 --> 01:03:40,646
- Go-go-go.
- I got it.

1122
01:03:40,671 --> 01:03:42,283
- Pull.
- Pull.

1123
01:03:52,918 --> 01:03:54,458
That was our way home.

1124
01:03:54,483 --> 01:03:57,088
We lost another island.
What is happening?

1125
01:03:57,113 --> 01:04:00,525
Haven't you heard?
Riley is running away.

1126
01:04:00,550 --> 01:04:01,955
What?

1127
01:04:02,958 --> 01:04:05,342
Wait wait. Hang on, guys.

1128
01:04:05,367 --> 01:04:08,269
Are we really doing this?
This is serious.

1129
01:04:08,294 --> 01:04:10,067
Look. We have no core memories.

1130
01:04:10,092 --> 01:04:11,390
You want Riley to be happy?

1131
01:04:11,415 --> 01:04:14,817
Let's go back to Minnesota
and make more.

1132
01:04:15,176 --> 01:04:18,608
Joy. If we hurry,
we can still stop her.

1133
01:04:19,483 --> 01:04:21,836
Family Island. Let's go.

1134
01:04:35,737 --> 01:04:37,048
Joy.

1135
01:04:37,073 --> 01:04:41,380
Joy. It's too dangerous.
We won't make it in time.

1136
01:04:44,138 --> 01:04:46,197
But, that's our only way back.

1137
01:04:58,031 --> 01:05:00,108
A recall tube.

1138
01:05:02,001 --> 01:05:04,123
We can get recall.

1139
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:09,382
Have a great day, sweetheart.

1140
01:05:09,407 --> 01:05:13,247
- See you after school, monkey.
- We love you.

1141
01:05:16,731 --> 01:05:18,848
Go, run run! Go!

1142
01:05:28,465 --> 01:05:30,050
Whoa whoa, Sadness.

1143
01:05:30,075 --> 01:05:32,061
Sadness. Stop.

1144
01:05:32,464 --> 01:05:36,039
- You're hurting Riley.
- No no no. I did it again.

1145
01:05:36,064 --> 01:05:40,392
If you get in here,
these core memories will get sad.

1146
01:05:45,242 --> 01:05:46,842
I'm sorry.

1147
01:05:46,867 --> 01:05:50,472
- Riley needs to be happy.
- Joy?

1148
01:05:59,756 --> 01:06:02,962
Aww!

1149
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:07,491
Joy. Aw!

1150
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:11,755
Joy!

1151
01:06:43,475 --> 01:06:45,080
Joy?

1152
01:06:51,655 --> 01:06:53,325
Joy!

1153
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:02,438
Joy. Joy, what're you doing?
Would you stop it, please.

1154
01:07:06,122 --> 01:07:10,134
Don't you get it, Joy.
We're stuck down here.

1155
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:12,391
We're forgotten.

1156
01:08:03,188 --> 01:08:09,463
Do you remember, how she used to stick
her tongue out when she was coloring.

1157
01:08:18,221 --> 01:08:22,594
I could listen to
her stories all day

1158
01:08:35,030 --> 01:08:38,787
I just wanted Riley to be happy.

1159
01:09:39,141 --> 01:09:43,199
It was the day the Prairie dogs
lost the big playoff game.

1160
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:47,192
Riley missed the winning shot.
She felt awful.

1161
01:09:47,217 --> 01:09:49,652
She wanted to quit.

1162
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:08,828
Sadness.

1163
01:10:09,584 --> 01:10:13,953
Mom and Dad. The team.

1164
01:10:13,978 --> 01:10:18,600
They came to help
because of sadness.

1165
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:25,980
We have to get back up there.

1166
01:10:26,336 --> 01:10:29,404
Joy, we're stuck down here.

1167
01:10:29,429 --> 01:10:32,250
We might as well be
on another planet.

1168
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:39,603
Another planet.

1169
01:10:41,677 --> 01:10:44,963
Who's your friend who likes to play?

1170
01:10:47,742 --> 01:10:50,728
Who's your friend who likes to play?

1171
01:10:50,753 --> 01:10:54,736
His rocket makes you yell "Hooray!"

1172
01:10:58,014 --> 01:11:01,232
Who's the best in every way,
and wants to sing this song to say.

1173
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:04,235
Who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing Bong. Bing Bong.

1174
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:06,749
His rocket makes you yell "Hooray!"

1175
01:11:19,884 --> 01:11:21,549
Hop in.

1176
01:11:24,895 --> 01:11:27,428
Who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing Bong. Bing Bong.

1177
01:11:27,453 --> 01:11:29,736
His rocket makes you yell "Hooray!"
Bing Bong, Bing Bong

1178
01:11:29,761 --> 01:11:33,051
Who's the best in every way,
and wants to sing this song to say.

1179
01:11:35,579 --> 01:11:37,756
His rocket makes you yell "Hooray!"
Bing Bong, Bing Bong

1180
01:11:37,781 --> 01:11:40,658
Who's the best in every way,
and wants to sing this song to say...

1181
01:11:40,683 --> 01:11:42,514
Aww!

1182
01:11:47,363 --> 01:11:49,085
Come on!

1183
01:11:59,396 --> 01:12:00,703
Aw!

1184
01:12:02,896 --> 01:12:04,700
Aw.

1185
01:12:10,431 --> 01:12:12,403
Come on Joy, one more time.

1186
01:12:12,862 --> 01:12:14,808
I got a feeling on this one.

1187
01:12:15,705 --> 01:12:17,888
His rocket makes you yell "Hooray!"
Bing Bong, Bing Bong

1188
01:12:17,914 --> 01:12:20,028
Who's the best in every way,
and wants to sing this song to say.

1189
01:12:20,053 --> 01:12:22,231
Who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing Bong. Bing Bong.

1190
01:12:22,330 --> 01:12:26,057
Louder! Louder!
Joy, sing louder!

1191
01:12:36,416 --> 01:12:38,370
We're gonna make it.

1192
01:12:44,250 --> 01:12:46,114
Woo-hoo.

1193
01:12:46,139 --> 01:12:48,667
Bing Bong, we did it!

1194
01:12:48,692 --> 01:12:50,985
We... Bing Bong?

1195
01:12:51,146 --> 01:12:52,535
Bing Bong!

1196
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:56,341
Ha ha! You made it! Ha ha!

1197
01:12:56,369 --> 01:13:00,499
Go! Go save Riley. Ha ha ha.

1198
01:13:01,714 --> 01:13:06,175
Take her to the moon for me.
Okay?

1199
01:13:11,831 --> 01:13:13,285
Oh.

1200
01:13:14,281 --> 01:13:16,006
Oh.

1201
01:13:18,884 --> 01:13:22,060
I'll try, Bing Bong.

1202
01:13:23,936 --> 01:13:25,854
I promise.

1203
01:13:39,010 --> 01:13:40,741
We're home!

1204
01:13:41,266 --> 01:13:45,071
Riley? Riley?

1205
01:13:48,307 --> 01:13:50,333
I'll call her cell.

1206
01:13:52,654 --> 01:13:54,277
Oh, this is terrible.

1207
01:13:54,302 --> 01:13:55,728
Wait. Is that someone
walking towards us?

1208
01:13:55,753 --> 01:13:57,703
Look. Let's cross the street.

1209
01:14:01,836 --> 01:14:03,490
It's Mom. She's on to us.

1210
01:14:03,515 --> 01:14:06,337
- What do we do?
- Where's my bag?
- Riley needs to get core memories.

1211
01:14:06,362 --> 01:14:08,470
We keep going.

1212
01:14:11,038 --> 01:14:12,664
Sadness!

1213
01:14:22,819 --> 01:14:25,016
Sadness? Sadness?

1214
01:14:25,041 --> 01:14:27,543
Come on, Sadness. Where are you?

1215
01:14:27,568 --> 01:14:30,844
Okay. If I were Sadness,
where would I be?

1216
01:14:31,222 --> 01:14:35,405
Oh. Everything is awful
and my legs don't work.

1217
01:14:35,430 --> 01:14:39,669
And you have to drag me around
while I touch all the...

1218
01:14:54,818 --> 01:14:56,894
Oh no. It's Mom again.
What do we do?

1219
01:14:56,919 --> 01:14:58,147
Uh.

1220
01:15:03,076 --> 01:15:05,409
This is madness.
She shouldn't run away.

1221
01:15:05,434 --> 01:15:07,510
Let's get this idea
out of her head.

1222
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:09,499
Sadness?

1223
01:15:10,753 --> 01:15:13,603
- Sadness.
- Joy?

1224
01:15:14,217 --> 01:15:16,007
Wait. Sadness.

1225
01:15:16,032 --> 01:15:19,955
Just let me go. Riley is
better of without me.

1226
01:15:19,980 --> 01:15:21,921
Come back!

1227
01:15:27,021 --> 01:15:30,067
You're saying your husband was
blown away by an elephant.

1228
01:15:30,092 --> 01:15:32,625
- Was he with anyone?
- Yes. And there she is!

1229
01:15:32,673 --> 01:15:33,973
Hey! Come back here!

1230
01:15:33,998 --> 01:15:37,116
Forget it Jake. It's cloud talk.

1231
01:15:41,087 --> 01:15:42,402
Sadness.

1232
01:15:42,427 --> 01:15:45,126
- I only make everything worse.
- Wait.

1233
01:15:45,153 --> 01:15:47,930
Sadness, we got to
get you back to...

1234
01:15:57,608 --> 01:15:58,929
- It's stuck.
- Oh, great.
- What?

1235
01:15:58,954 --> 01:16:00,763
- What do you mean it's stuck?
- Now what?

1236
01:16:00,788 --> 01:16:03,778
No-no-no. What is this?

1237
01:16:11,990 --> 01:16:13,408
- How do we stop it?
- I got it.

1238
01:16:13,433 --> 01:16:15,740
Make her feel scared.
That will change her mind.

1239
01:16:15,772 --> 01:16:17,716
- Brilliant.
- I know it's brilliant. Do it.

1240
01:16:17,756 --> 01:16:19,599
Nothings working.
Why isn't it working?

1241
01:16:19,624 --> 01:16:21,320
- Let me try.
- Wait. You broke it.
- No.

1242
01:16:21,345 --> 01:16:23,861
- Move. Move.
- Let me do it. Get out of here.

1243
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:27,289
No.

1244
01:16:27,314 --> 01:16:31,273
Guys. We can't make
Riley feel anything.

1245
01:16:31,634 --> 01:16:34,050
What have we done?

1246
01:16:34,130 --> 01:16:37,123
Hey. Hey, look at me.
Did you mean what you said before.

1247
01:16:37,148 --> 01:16:39,318
I would die for Riley.
I would die for Riley.

1248
01:16:39,343 --> 01:16:42,179
Yeah yeah. Okay, haircut.
Time to prove it.

1249
01:16:45,031 --> 01:16:47,874
I would die for Riley.
I would die for Riley.

1250
01:16:47,899 --> 01:16:50,454
I would die for Riley.
I would die for Riley.

1251
01:17:05,511 --> 01:17:08,005
That's it. I fold.

1252
01:17:25,113 --> 01:17:27,620
Whao...

1253
01:17:29,472 --> 01:17:30,902
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

1254
01:17:30,927 --> 01:17:35,042
Whoa. Okay. Whoa.

1255
01:17:35,067 --> 01:17:38,016
- Woo-woo-woo.
- Whoa.

1256
01:17:38,041 --> 01:17:40,121
This is crazy. This is crazy.

1257
01:17:40,146 --> 01:17:42,704
No no no. Joy, be positive.

1258
01:17:45,716 --> 01:17:48,465
I'm positive this is crazy.

1259
01:17:51,765 --> 01:17:52,929
NOW!

1260
01:17:52,954 --> 01:17:57,712
For Riley... For Riley...

1261
01:18:02,241 --> 01:18:04,756
- Joy?
- Hang on.

1262
01:18:05,403 --> 01:18:07,987
Oh, I wished Joy was here.

1263
01:18:15,311 --> 01:18:16,311


1264
01:18:16,775 --> 01:18:19,253
Stand back. Yah!

1265
01:18:19,422 --> 01:18:22,839
- That work.
- Well, what would you do if you're so smart.

1266
01:18:22,864 --> 01:18:25,972
I'll tell you.
But you're too dumb to understand.

1267
01:18:25,997 --> 01:18:28,250
- What!
- Of course your tiny brain is confuse.

1268
01:18:28,275 --> 01:18:31,290
Guess I'll just have to dumb it
down to your level.

1269
01:18:31,315 --> 01:18:34,790
Sorry I don't speak moron
as well as you. But let me try.

1270
01:18:34,814 --> 01:18:36,215
Duh.

1271
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:42,520
AWWWW!

1272
01:18:46,105 --> 01:18:47,549
Oh. Thank goodness you're back.

1273
01:18:47,574 --> 01:18:49,737
- Things are really messed up.
- We-we-we found this idea.

1274
01:18:49,762 --> 01:18:51,260
Oh no.

1275
01:19:01,209 --> 01:19:02,829
Joy, you got to fix this.
Get out there.

1276
01:19:02,855 --> 01:19:05,301
- Sadness, it's up to you.
- Me?

1277
01:19:05,326 --> 01:19:07,206
- Sadness?
- Sadness? - Sadness?

1278
01:19:07,234 --> 01:19:09,418
- I can't, Joy.
- Yes you can.

1279
01:19:09,443 --> 01:19:11,995
Riley, needs you.

1280
01:19:23,105 --> 01:19:24,527
Okay.

1281
01:19:44,691 --> 01:19:47,899
Wait. Stop. I want to get off.

1282
01:19:58,773 --> 01:20:00,632
Alright. Thank you, we will.

1283
01:20:00,657 --> 01:20:03,208
- Her teacher hasn't even seen Riley all day.
- What?

1284
01:20:03,233 --> 01:20:04,229
What was she wearing last?

1285
01:20:04,254 --> 01:20:06,294
- Can't believe this.
- Do you even remember what...

1286
01:20:06,561 --> 01:20:07,679
- Riley.
- Hey. There you are.

1287
01:20:07,704 --> 01:20:08,878
- Thank goodness.
- Oh, we were worried sick.

1288
01:20:08,906 --> 01:20:10,766
- Where have you been?
It's so late.
- Oh.

1289
01:20:10,791 --> 01:20:13,442
Riley, what happened?
Are you alright..

1290
01:20:34,481 --> 01:20:42,481
<font color="#ffff00"><font color="#0080c0">>>>Subtitle created by lamVincent Please Rate<<<</font>
<font color="#ff0000">www.subscene.com</font>

1291
01:21:42,694 --> 01:21:46,180
I know you don't want me to.
But.

1292
01:21:47,124 --> 01:21:49,454
I missed home.

1293
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:52,885
I missed Minnesota.

1294
01:21:55,396 --> 01:21:58,024
You need me to be happy.

1295
01:21:58,049 --> 01:21:59,400
But.

1296
01:22:00,355 --> 01:22:05,809
I want my old friends
and hockey team

1297
01:22:07,237 --> 01:22:09,418
I want to go home.

1298
01:22:10,699 --> 01:22:13,139
Please don't be mad.

1299
01:22:15,433 --> 01:22:18,925
- Oh, sweetie.
- We're not mad.

1300
01:22:19,858 --> 01:22:24,279
You know what?
I missed Minnesota too.

1301
01:22:25,155 --> 01:22:28,619
I missed the woods
that we took hikes.

1302
01:22:28,741 --> 01:22:31,748
And the backyard where
you used to play.

1303
01:22:31,773 --> 01:22:35,722
Spring lake.
Where you learned to skate.

1304
01:22:36,933 --> 01:22:38,571
Come here.

1305
01:22:39,495 --> 01:22:44,495


1306
01:23:59,365 --> 01:24:00,963
Hey. I'm liking this new view.

1307
01:24:00,988 --> 01:24:02,527
Friendship Island has expanded.

1308
01:24:02,552 --> 01:24:05,183
Glad they finally opened that
friendly argument section.

1309
01:24:05,208 --> 01:24:07,287
I like
Tragic Vampire Romance Island.

1310
01:24:07,316 --> 01:24:10,109
Fashion Island.
Everyone shut up.

1311
01:24:10,134 --> 01:24:12,272
Boy Band Island?
That's just a phase.

1312
01:24:12,297 --> 01:24:16,441
Say what you want.
I think it's all beautiful.

1313
01:24:16,466 --> 01:24:17,736
Alright. Here you go.

1314
01:24:17,761 --> 01:24:20,805
Your new expanded console
is up and running.

1315
01:24:20,833 --> 01:24:22,294
- Whoa.
- Wow.

1316
01:24:22,319 --> 01:24:23,619
- Cool. Upgrade.
- Woo.

1317
01:24:23,644 --> 01:24:26,066
Aye, ho ho.
Whoops, did I just do that?

1318
01:24:26,091 --> 01:24:28,797
Okay. Guys, what is 'PUBERTY'.

1319
01:24:28,822 --> 01:24:30,727
I don't know.
It's probably not important.

1320
01:24:30,752 --> 01:24:35,033
Whoa. I have access to the
entire curse word library.

1321
01:24:35,058 --> 01:24:38,207
This new console is the...

1322
01:24:38,232 --> 01:24:39,941
Sorry. I did it again. My bad.

1323
01:24:39,973 --> 01:24:41,794
They're getting to the rink.

1324
01:24:42,281 --> 01:24:44,453
Now, when you get out there.
You be aggressive.

1325
01:24:44,478 --> 01:24:46,092
- I know Dad.
- Not too aggressive.

1326
01:24:46,117 --> 01:24:48,953
You know. You guys don't have
to come to every game.

1327
01:24:48,978 --> 01:24:51,130
Are you kidding?
I'm not missing one!

1328
01:24:51,155 --> 01:24:52,917
- Go Fog Horns!
- Go Riley!

1329
01:24:52,942 --> 01:24:54,212
- Fog.. Horns...
- Okay okay.
- Fog Horns

1330
01:24:54,237 --> 01:24:56,806
- I got to go.
- The best...

1331
01:24:56,831 --> 01:24:57,942
- Oh.
- They love us.

1332
01:24:57,967 --> 01:24:59,646
Yeah. Mom and Dad
are pretty cool.

1333
01:24:59,671 --> 01:25:03,193
Guys, of course they are.
But we can't show it.

1334
01:25:03,370 --> 01:25:04,416
Yeh. Yeh.

1335
01:25:04,441 --> 01:25:05,814
She loved the face painting.

1336
01:25:05,839 --> 01:25:08,259
Ha.
Told you it was a great idea.

1337
01:25:08,418 --> 01:25:11,917
- Best idea he's had in a while.
- He's a really good guy.

1338
01:25:11,942 --> 01:25:13,786
- Ah.
- Oh.

1339
01:25:16,659 --> 01:25:18,703
Just in case.

1340
01:25:18,988 --> 01:25:20,236
Oh.

1341
01:25:21,569 --> 01:25:23,221
Sorry.

1342
01:25:24,289 --> 01:25:26,689
- Aww!
- GIRL! GIRL!

1343
01:25:26,725 --> 01:25:28,964
- Oh oh.
- GIRL!

1344
01:25:31,573 --> 01:25:34,290
Okay. Bye.

1345
01:25:38,322 --> 01:25:40,212
Hey Riley.

1346
01:25:43,470 --> 01:25:45,217
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1347
01:25:45,245 --> 01:25:48,732
Alright. Let's play some hockey.

1348
01:25:48,757 --> 01:25:51,053
- Alright, Anger. Take over.
- Give us that puck or you're dead meat!

1349
01:25:51,078 --> 01:25:52,146
On her left. On her left!

1350
01:25:52,189 --> 01:25:53,743
Let's just try not to get
all smelly this time.

1351
01:25:53,768 --> 01:25:56,238
Oh. Mom and Dad
are watching us fail.

1352
01:25:56,264 --> 01:25:58,373
Not for long!

1353
01:25:59,223 --> 01:26:01,163
We've been through a lot
lately that's for sure.

1354
01:26:01,188 --> 01:26:03,386
But we sill love our girl.

1355
01:26:03,414 --> 01:26:05,970
She has great new friends
and great new house.

1356
01:26:05,995 --> 01:26:07,654
Things couldn't be better.

1357
01:26:07,679 --> 01:26:10,301
After all, Riley is 12 now.

1358
01:26:10,326 --> 01:26:12,001
What could happen?

1359
01:26:32,260 --> 01:26:35,938
And who can tell me what year
San Francisco was founded.

1360
01:26:35,963 --> 01:26:37,068
Anyone?

1361
01:26:37,292 --> 01:26:39,841
- Jordan.
- Uh.

1362
01:26:40,613 --> 01:26:41,629
How much more of this?

1363
01:26:41,662 --> 01:26:45,444
5 months 2 weeks and 4 days
until summer vacation.

1364
01:26:45,469 --> 01:26:48,928
Then it's off to the Bahamas
with you know who.

1365
01:26:49,201 --> 01:26:52,348
Come.
Fly with me, criancinha. (baby)

1366
01:26:52,473 --> 01:26:53,593
- Ah.
- Ah.

1367
01:26:56,207 --> 01:26:57,669
Have a nice day.

1368
01:26:57,846 --> 01:26:59,484
What are we mad about?

1369
01:26:59,512 --> 01:27:01,730
I don't know.
Whatever Troy is mad about.

1370
01:27:01,854 --> 01:27:03,302
What's Troy mad about?

1371
01:27:03,327 --> 01:27:05,498
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

1372
01:27:05,585 --> 01:27:07,004
I know, I told her that.

1373
01:27:07,561 --> 01:27:10,282
We are a total fraud.
Do you think they can see through us.

1374
01:27:10,314 --> 01:27:11,952
Of course not.
We're wearing eye shadow.

1375
01:27:11,992 --> 01:27:14,319
Being cool is so exhausting.

1376
01:27:14,967 --> 01:27:17,598
Who's the birthday girl? Huh.

1377
01:27:17,923 --> 01:27:21,581
Hey. Hello?

1378
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:25,179
6 years of drama school
for this.

1379
01:27:29,789 --> 01:27:30,848
- What?
- Let's move.

1380
01:27:31,373 --> 01:27:33,153
Look. This is okay.
This is fine.

1381
01:27:33,478 --> 01:27:35,660
We just need to go
to our happy place.

1382
01:27:35,741 --> 01:27:38,347
- Aw!
- Aww!

1383
01:28:05,191 --> 01:28:10,234
