[The movie starts off]

    Joy: [voice-over] "Do you ever look at someone and wonder, what is going on inside their head? Well, I know. Well, I know Riley’s head."

[we see Riley as a new born baby, we then see inside her mind where Joy is formed]

    Joy: [voice-over] "And there she was." [Joy watches Riley’s parents through Riley’s eyes]

    Mom: "Hello. Riley."
    Dad: "Oh, look at you. Aren’t you a little bundle of joy."

[Joy sees an orb being form with the memory of her looking up at her parents]

    Joy: "Whoa."

[She puts the core memory back and it lights up headquarters.]

    Joy: [voice-over] "It was amazing. Just Riley and me forever."

[Suddenly Baby Riley begins crying]

    Joy: [voice-over] "Er, for 33 seconds."

[in Riley’s mind we see Sadness standing next to Joy touching the control console]

    Sadness: "I’m Sadness."

[She extends her hand to Joy and they shake hands]

    Joy: "Oh, hello. I’m Joy, so. Can I just, if you could…I just want to fix that."

[Joy tries to push Sadness out of the way of the control console]

    Joy: "Thanks."
    Joy: [voice-over] "And that was just the beginning. Headquarters only got more crowded from there."

[We see Riley a few years older running around her house playing, while in her mind there is Fear, Joy and Sadness]

    Fear: "Very nice. Okay, looks like you got this. Very good. Whoa, sharp turn…! no, look out, no!"

[He pushes Joy out of the control console to take over]

    Joy: [voice-over] "That’s Fear. He’s really good at keeping Riley safe."

[We see Riley hesitate as she reaches a lamps electric cord lying on the ground]

    Fear: "Easy. Easy. Ahh. Hop it!"

[Riley carefully places her feet over the cord to avoid tripping on it]

    Fear: "Oh, we’re good. We’re good."

[A purple memory came through.]

    Both: "Whoo. Good job."
    Fear: "Thank you. Thank you very much."
    Joy: "And we’re back!"

[Joy takes over the control console and Riley continues to play and run around the living room. Riley is sat in her high chair being fed broccoli by her parents]

    Dad: "Here we go, alright. Open."

[Inside her mind Riley’s emotions are watching through her eyes]

    Joy: "Hm, this looks new."
    Fear: "Think it’s safe?"
    Sadness: "What is it?"
    Disgust: "Okay, caution. There is a dangerous smell, people. Hold on. What is that?"
    Joy: [voice-over] "This is Disgust. She basically keeps Riley from being poison, physically and socially."

[As they watch Riley’s dad trying to feed her broccoli]

    Disgust: "That is not brightly colored. Or shaped like a dinosaur. Hold on guys. It’s broccoli!"

[She quickly presses the control button on the console and Riley flips the plate of broccoli aside in disgust]

    Riley: "Yucky!"

[It lands on her dad's face and also a green memory comes through.]

    Disgust: "Well. I just saved our lives."
    All: (Sigh in relief).
    Disgust: "Yeah, you’re welcome."
    Dad: "Riley, if you don’t eat your dinner, you’re not gonna get any dessert."
    Anger: "Wait. Did he just say we couldn’t have dessert?"
    Joy: [voice-over] "That’s Anger. He cares very deeply about things being fair."

[Anger stomps over to the control console in Riley’s mind]

    Anger: "So, that’s how you want to play it, old man! No dessert? Oh, sure! We’ll eat our dinner! Right after you eat this!" [When his Head Ignites, He flips the control as his head blows out fire.]

[Riley starts to throw a tantrum in anger. A red memory orb came through.]

    Dad: “Riley, Riley. Here comes an airplane.”

[Anger stops being angry and steps aside]

    Anger: "Oh! Airplane. We got an airplane, everybody."
    All: "Ooh."

[Riley’s dad manages to use the airplane trick to feed Riley the broccoli and yellow memory orb is formed. Sadness stands next to Joy as they watch Riley being fed by her dad]

    Joy: [voice-over] "And you’ve met Sadness. She…well, she…"

[We see Riley crying on a variety of days showing Sadness taking over her emotions. Like broken toy, spilled ice cream, tantrum at the store, and wanted out of her car seat.]

    Joy: [voice-over] "I’m not actually sure what she does. And I’ve checked, there’s no place for her to go. So, she’s good. We’re good. It’s all great."

[She goes over to the memory orbs]

    Joy: [voice-over] "Anyway. These are Riley’s memories. And they are mostly happy if you’ll notice, not to brag."

[She watches a memory of Riley and Maggie going down the slide and she replays it.]

    Joy: [voice-over] "But the really important ones are over here."

[She goes over to a hub in the middle of the headquarters.]

    Joy: [voice-over] "I don’t want to get too technical but these are called core memories. Each one came from a super important time in Riley’s life. Like when she first scored a goal. It was so amazing."

[We see Riley playing ice hockey with her parents and celebrating after she scores a goal.]

    Joy: [voice-over] "And each core memory powers a different aspect of Riley’s personality."

[We see the core memories powering five islands.]

    Joy: [voice-over] Like, Hockey Island. Goofball Island is my personal favorite.

[We see memory of Riley as she runs away from her dad as he tries to put clothes on her and she goofballs around to get away from him.]

    Joy: [voice-over] "Yup. Goofball is the best. Friendship Island is pretty good too."

[We see Riley and Maggie playing with each other.]

    Joy: [voice-over] "Ooh, I love Honesty Island. And that’s the truth."

[We see Riley holding up a hammer and fixing a broken glass.]

    Joy: [voice-over] "And of course, Family Island is amazing."

[We see Riley feeding dad a cookie.]

    Joy: [voice-over] "The point is, the islands are personality are what make Riley, Riley."

[We see Riley growing up and making memories along the way with Joy being the main organizer.]

    Dad: "Good night."
    Riley: "Good night Dad."

[Joy watches through Riley eyes as she getting ready to sleep and they closed.]

    Joy: "And we’re out. That’s what I’m talking about. Wooh! Another perfect day. Nice job everybody. Let’s get those memories down to long term."
    Fear: "Alright. We did not die today. I call that an unqualified success."

[The emotions watch as the memory orbs are taken away]

    Joy: [voice-over] "And, that’s it. We love our girl. She’s got great friends and a great house. Things couldn’t be better. After all, Riley is eleven now. What could happen?"

[The next day the emotions watch as Riley’s family house is sold]

    Joy: "What?"
    All: (Yelping).

[The emotions watch in horror as a removal truck takes the furniture and drives off]

    Joy: "Okay. Not what I had in mind."
    All: (Screaming).

[Riley and her parents drive to San Francisco]

    Joy: "Hey, look! The Golden Gate Bridge! Isn’t that great? It’s not made up of solid gold like we thought, which is kind of a disappointment. But still…"
    Fear: "I sure am glad you told me earthquakes are a myth, Joy. Otherwise I’d be terrified right now."
    Joy: "Uh…yeah."

[Referring to the cars honking their horns as Riley and her parents are stuck in traffic]

    Anger: "These are my kind of people."
    Dad: "Alright, just a few more blocks. We’re almost to our new house."
    Anger: "Step on it, Daddy."
    Disgust: "Why can’t we just live in the smelly car? We’re already been in it forever."
    Joy: "Which… actually was really lucky. Because that gave us plenty of time to think about what our new house is going to look like. What? Let’s review the top five daydreams."

[She plays Riley’s fantasy of what their new house will look like, first one is a house with a massive slide going along the side of it]

    Fear: "Ooh, that looks safe."
    Sadness: "That looks nice."

[Referring to a house made on top of a tree]

    Joy: "Ooh, this will be great for Riley. Oh! No, no, no, this one."

[She shows them a house made out of cookies]

    Disgust: "Joy, for the last time, she cannot live in a cookie."

[The next house is a castle with a dragon flying above it]

    Anger: "That’s the one. It comes with a dragon."
    Joy: "Are we getting close? I can feel it. Here it is. Here’s our new house. And…"

[Riley’s dad pulls up outside their new house, Riley gets out of the car and looks up and look clearly disappointed when she sees their house]

    Joy: "Maybe, it’s nice on the inside."

[As Riley enters the house, she looks around while the emotions talk in her head. Riley sniffs the air and maons in disgust.]

    Anger: "We’re supposed to live here?"
    Sadness: "Do we have to?"
    Disgust: "I’m telling you, it smells that something died in here."

[A green memory orb appeared.]

    Fear: "Can you die from moving?"
    Joy: "Guys, you’re overreacting. Nobody is die…"
    Disgust: "A DEAD MOUSE!"

[Dissolve to a dead mouse]

    Fear: AAAH!!!
    Anger: "Great."
    Disgust: "I’m gonna be sick."
    Fear: "It’s a house of the dead! What are we gonna do? We’re gonna get rabies!"

[Fear jumps onto Anger’s head]

    Anger: "Get off of me!"

[Anger blows fire off his head which makes Fear jump off as it sets fire to his backside]

    Joy: "All through the drive, Dad talked about how cool our new room is. Let’s go check it out."
    Fear: "It’s gonna be great. Yes, yes, yes, yes!"

[Riley quickly goes to see her new room which is just as bad as the rest of the house]

    Fear: "No, no, no, no."
    Disgust: "I’m starting to envy the dead mouse."
    Anger: "Get out the rubber ball. We’re in solitary confinement."
    Sadness: "Riley can’t live here."
    Anger: "She’s right."
    Disgust: "It’s the worst."
    Fear: "Really bad."
    Disgust: "It’s absolutely the worst."
    Anger: "This house stinks."
    Disgust: "It’s the worst place I’ve been in my entire life."
    Fear: "Oh, yeah."

[Joy looks in dismay as more memory sphere are made based Riley’s feelings on the new house and room]

    Joy: "Hey, it’s nothing our butterfly curtains couldn’t fix. I read somewhere that an empty room is an opportunity."
    Anger: "Where did you read that?"
    Joy: "It doesn’t matter, I read it and it’s great. We’ll put the bed there, and the desk over there."
    Fear: "The hockey lamp goes there."
    Anger: "Uh, put the chair there."
    Joy: "Or the trophy collections."
    Fear: "There. Stars! I like that."
    Joy: "Now, we’re talking. Let’s go get our stuff from the moving van."

[As Riley goes down to get her stuff from the moving van she overhears her parents.]

    Dad: "Well, guess what? The moving van won’t be here until Thursday."
    Mom: "You’re kidding."

[As they watch this through Riley’s eyes.]

    Fear: "Our van is lost? It’s the worst day ever!"

[Joy watches as Riley makes more bad memories.]

    Mom: "You said it would be here yesterday."
    Dad: "And I know that’s what I said. That’s what they told me."
    Fear: "Mom and Dad are stressed out!"
    Anger: "They’re stressed out?"
    Someone: "Arguing!"
    Fear: "What are we going to do?"

[As Riley watches her parents arguing over the lost van Joy gets an idea.]

    Joy: "I’ve got a great idea!"
    Mom: "Did you even read the contract?"

[Riley starts playing hockey with a piece of balled up paper]

    Riley: "Andersen makes her move. She’s closing in."
    Dad: "Hey. Oh no, you’re not."

[Her dad joins in the game.]

    Dad: "Oh no. You're not."
    Riley: "She's lining up for the shot she shoots and she scores yeah."
    All: (Cheering).
    Riley: "C'mon Grandma."
    Mom: "Ha! Grandma."

[She puts up her hair.]

    Joy: "Uh-oh. She's putting her hair up. We're in for it."

[Mom is the guard, and the parents have a pile. A yellow memory orb appeared. The game gets interrupted by a phone call.]

    Dad: Sorry, hold on. [he answers the call] Hello?
    Joy: Wait. What?

[Riley watches her dad in dismay as he talks on the phone]

    Dad: You’re kidding. Alright. Stall for me, I’ll be right there.

[to Riley and her mom]

    Dad: The investors are supposed to show up on Thursday, not today. I gotta go.
    Mom: It’s okay, we get it.
    Dad: You’re the best. Thanks, hon.

[he kisses her and waves to Riley]

    Dad: See you, sweetie.

[Dad turns and leaves the house]

    Fear: Dad just left us.
    Sadness: Oh, he doesn’t love us anymore. That’s sad. I should drive, right?

[as she goes to take over the control console Joy stops her]

    Sadness: Joy, what are you doing?
    Joy: Uh, just give me one second. Um, you know what I’ve realized? Riley hasn’t had lunch. Remember?
    Riley: [to her mom] Hey, I saw a pizza place down the street. Maybe we could try that.
    Mom: Pizza sounds delicious.
    Fear: Pizza!
    Anger: Pizza.
    Disgust: Yes, pizza.
    Anger: Great idea. Let’s get it.

[Riley and her mom are at the pizza place, the girl at the counter hands over a pizza with broccoli on top]

    Fear: What the heck is that?
    Joy: Who puts broccoli on pizza!
    Disgust: That’s it, I’m done.
    Anger: Congratulations San Francisco, you’ve ruined pizza! First the Hawaiians, and now you!

[as Riley and her mom walk back to their house]

    Mom: What kind of a pizza place only serves one kind of pizza? Must be a San Francisco thing. Still, it’s not as bad as the soup at that diner in Nebraska.
    Riley: Oh, yeah. The spoon stood up in the soup by itself. That was disgusting.

[Joy feels relief as Riley and her mom continue to bond]

    Joy: We’re good. Family’s running.
    Mom: The drive out was pretty fun, huh? What was your favorite part?
    Anger: Spitting out of the car window!
    Disgust: Definitely not when Dad was singing.
    Fear: Wearing a seat belt.
    Joy: Oh, what about the time with the dinosaur?

[Joy quickly brings up the memory on the control console]

    Fear: Oh, that’s the one.

[to her mom as she recalls the memory]

    Riley: I like that time with the dinosaur, that was pretty funny.

[suddenly Riley’s becomes sad and her memory clouds over]

    Joy: Wait, what? What happened?

[the emotions turn to see Sadness touching the memory]

    Fear: She did something to the memory.

[Joy takes the memory orb]

    Joy: What did you do?
    Sadness: I…I just touched it.
    Joy: That shouldn’t make it change.
    Fear: Oh, change it back, Joy!
    Joy: I’m trying.
    Anger: You can’t change it back?
    Joy: No. I guess I can’t.
    Disgust: Good going, Sadness. Now when Riley thinks of that moment with Dad, she’s gonna feel sad. Bravo.
    Sadness: I’m sorry, Joy. I don’t really know. I thought maybe if you, if you, I…
    Disgust: Joy, we got a stairway coming up.

[Riley and her mom are approaching a large sidewalk stairway]

    Joy: Just don’t touch any other memories until we figured out what’s going on.
    Sadness: Okay.
    Joy: Alright. Get ready. This is the monster railing and we are riding it all the way down.

[Riley gets ready to slide down the banister when she suddenly looks sad and step off]

    Joy: Wait, what? What happened?

[suddenly a memory orb slides over and hits Joy on her leg]

    Fear: A core memory!
    Joy: Oh, no.

[suddenly Goofball Island stops working]

    Joy: Sadness, what are you doing?
    Sadness: It looked like one was crooked, so I opened it and then it fell out.

[Joy puts the core memory back into its place and Goofball Island starts working again, Riley cheers up and slides down the banister]

    Sadness: It’s just that, I wanted to maybe hold one.

[Sadness goes to pick up another memory orb]

    Fear: Joy!

[Joy pushes Sadness’s hand up to stop her]

    Joy: Woah, woah, woah! Sadness, you nearly touch a core memory. And if you touch them, we can’t change them back!
    Sadness: Oh, I know. I’m sorry. Something’s wrong with me. I… it’s like I’m having a break down.
    Joy: You’re not having a break down. It’s stress.
    Sadness: I keep making mistakes like that. I’m awful.
    Joy: No, you’re not.
    Sadness: And annoying.
    Joy: They, well, uh, you know what? You can’t focus on what’s going wrong. There’s always a way to turn things around, to find the fun.
    Sadness: Yeah, find the fun. I don’t know how to do that.
    Joy: Okay. Well, try to think of something funny.
    Sadness: Um. Oh, remember the funny movie where the dog dies?
    Joy: Oh, yeah. That’s not…
    Joy: What about that time, with Meg? When Riley laughed so hard, milk came out of her nose.

[Joy starts laughing as she remembers]

    Joy: Come on.
    Sadness: Yeah, that hurt. It felt like fire. It was awf…
    Joy: Okay, okay. Don’t think of that. Let’s try something else. Um, what’re your favorite things to do?
    Sadness: My favorite? Um, well, I like it when we’re outside.
    Joy: That’s good! Like, there’s the beach and sunshine. Oh, like the time we buried Dad in the sand up to his neck.
    Sadness: I was thinking more like rain.
    Joy: Rain. Rain is my favorite too! We can stomp around the puddles, you know? There’s cool umbrellas, lightning storms.
    Sadness: More like when the rain runs down our back, and makes our shoe soggy. And we get all cold, shivery and everything just starts feeling droopy.

[Sadness falls onto her face crying]

    Joy: Oh. Hey, hey, hey. Easy. Why are you crying? It’s…it’s like really the opposite of what we’re going for here.
    Sadness: Crying helps me slow down and obsessive over the weight of life’s problems.
    Joy: You know what? Let’s, uh, think about something else. How about we read some mind manuals? Huh? Sounds fun.

[she takes Sadness over the manuals]

    Sadness: I’ve read most of them.
    Joy: Well, have you read this one? This seem interesting.

[she picks up a manual and opens to read it]

    Joy: Long Term Memory Retrieval Volume 47.

[she give the manual to Sadness]

    Sadness: No.
    Joy: Ooh, a real page turner.

[reads from the manual]

    Sadness: Long term memory data selection via channels sub-grouping.
    Joy: See! Fun already. Oh, you lucky dog. You’re reading these cool things, I gotta go work. Life is so unfair.

[Joy walks off looking worn out from trying to cheer Sadness up. A green memory orb rolls in and Joy's face falls with a groan.Riley walks down the stairs and watches her parents, her mom is busy cleaning up the house and her dad is on the phone with his work]

    Riley: Mom, Dad. Come kiss me good night.
    Mom: Be right there!

[Riley goes back to her bed looking upset that her parents are so busy]

    Fear: Did you hear Dad? He sounded really upset.

[suddenly a car outside goes by with a loud engine making Riley scared]

    Fear: What was that? Was it a bear? It’s a bear!
    Disgust: There are no bears in San Francisco.
    Anger: I saw a really hairy guy, he looked like a bear.
    Fear: Ooh, I’m so jumpy. My nerves are shot!
    Disgust: Ew! I don’t wanna hear about your nerves.
    Anger: I’ll tell you what it is. This move has been a bust.

    Fear: That’s what I’ve been telling you guys. There are at least 37 things for Riley to be scared of right now.
    Disgust: The smell alone is enough to make her gag.
    Anger: I can’t believe Mom and Dad moved us here!
    Joy: Look, I get it. You guys have concerns. But we’ve been through worse. Tell you what, let’s make a list of all the things Riley should be happy about.
    Anger: Fine. Let’s see. This house stinks. Our room stinks.
    Disgust: Pizza is weird here.
    Sadness: Our friends are back home.
    Fear: And all our stuff is in the missing van.
    Joy: Oh, come on. It could be worse.
    Disgust: Yeah, Joy. We could be lying on a dirty floor, in a bag.

[we see Riley sleeping on the floor in her sleeping bag]

    Joy: Okay, I admit it. We had a rough start. But think of all the good things that…
    Anger: No, Joy. There’s absolutely no reason for Riley to be happy right now. Let us handle this.
    Fear: I say we skip school tomorrow and lock ourselves in the bedroom.
    Disgust: We have no clean clothes. I mean no one should see us
    Sadness: Yeah, we could cry until we can’t breathe.
    Anger: We should lock the door and scream that curse word we know. It’s a good one!
    Joy: Now, hold on. Look, we all have our off days. You know…

[the emotions watch as Riley’s mom comes to her room to say good night]

    Mom: Hi, honey.
    Anger: The Mom bad news train is pulling in. Toot-toot!
    Mom: Still no moving van. Now they’re saying it won’t be here till Tuesday. Can you believe it?
    Anger: Toot-toot-toot!
    Riley: Where’s Dad?
    Mom: On the phone. This new adventure is keeping him pretty busy.
    Anger: I rest my case.
    Mom: Your Dad’s a little stress, you know, about getting his new company up and running…

[looking disheartened Joy goes to the side while the other emotions take over the controls]

    Anger: Now, for a few well place withering scowls.
    Mom: I guess all I really want to say is, thank you.
    Anger: Huh?
    Mom: You know, through all these confusion you’ve stayed… Well, you’ve stayed our happy girl. Your Dad is under a lot of pressure. But, if you and I can keep smiling, it would be a big help. We can do that for him. Right?
    Joy: Whoa.

[Joy comes over to take over the controls]

    Joy: Well.

[Riley smiles]

    Riley: Yeah, sure. What did we do to deserve you?

[she kisses Riley good night, turns off the light and gets up to leave]

    Mom: Sweet dreams.
    Riley: Good night.
    Anger: Well, you can’t argue with Mom. Happy it is.
    Disgust: Can’t argue with Mom, that’s true.
    Fear: Team Happy. Sounds great.
    Disgust: Totally behind you, Joy.

[Riley closes her eyes to sleep]

    Joy: Looks like we’re going into REM. I’ve got dream duty so I’ll take care of sending these to long term. Great day today, guys. Oh, sleep well, team Happy.
    [The team heads off to bed. Harp music plays.]
    Joy: All right. What's on tonight, Dream Production?
    [On the screen, a dream comes up.]
    [The family flies happily through the air in the car. They land in front of the house...]
    Dad: Well, this is it. The new place.

[...except it's haunted! Organ music. Ghosts howling. The dead mouse rises up into frame.]

Mouse: Come live with me, Riley. [grunts]

Bear: Somebody order a broccoli pizza?

Pizza Guy 1: Eat me!

Pizza Guy 2: I'm organic!

[after Joy sees that Riley is having a nightmare about her move the new house and city]

    Joy: [sighs] No! Who is in charge of programming down there? I know I’m not supposed to do this, but…

[she turns off Riley’s nightmare]

    Joy: We are not going to end the day like this.

[Joy brings up a core memory so that Riley can dream ice skating with her family]

    Joy: Don’t you worry. I’m going to make sure that tomorrow is another great day. I promise.

[the next morning Joy is playing "Reveille" on the accordion to wake up the other emotions]

    Joy: Hello. Did I wake you?
    Anger: Do you have to play that?
    Joy: Well, I have to practice. And I don’t think of it as playing so much as hugging.

[she throws the accordion aside]

    Joy: Okay, first day of school. Very, very exciting. I was up late last night figuring out a new plan. Here it is! Fear, I need a list of all the possible negative outcomes on the first day at a new school.
    Fear: Way ahead of you there. Does anyone know how to spell meteor?
    Joy: Disgust, make sure Riley stands out today. But also blends in.
    Disgust: When I’m through, I think you're look so good, the other things will look at their own outfits and barf.

    Joy: [to herself] Joy. Yes, Joy. You’ll be in charge of the console, keeping Riley happy all day long. And may I add, I love your dress, it’s adorable. Oh, this old thing. Thank you so much. I love the way it twirls.

[spots the train heading towards them]

    Joy: Train of Thought, right on schedule. Anger, unload the daydreams. I ordered extra, in case things get slow in class.
    Anger: Might come in handy, if this new school is full of boring, useless classes. Which it probably will be.
    Joy: Oh, Sadness. I have a super important job just for you.
    Sadness: Really?
    Joy: Um-hmm. Follow me.

[Joy draws a circle with a chalk around where Sadness is standing]

    Sadness: What are you doing?
    Joy: And there, perfect. This is the circle of sadness. Your job is to make sure that all the sadness stays inside of it.

    Sadness: So, you want me just to stand here?

    Joy: Hey, it’s not my place to tell you how to do your job. Just make sure that all the sadness stays in the circle. See! You’re a pro at this. Isn’t this fun?
    Sadness: No.
    Joy: ‘At a girl.
    Joy: Alright everyone, fresh start. We are going to have a good day which will turn into a good week, which will turn into a good year, which turns into a good life!

[they watch as Riley’s mom helps her to get off to school]

    Mom: So, big day. New school. New friends. Huh?
    Riley: I know. I’m kind of nervous, but I’m mostly excited. How do I look? Do you like my shirt?
    Mom: Very cute. You gonna be okay? You want us to walk with you?
    Disgust: Mom and Dad, with us in public. No, thank you.
    Joy: Yep, I’m on it.

[she presses a button the console]

    Riley: Nope, I’m fine. Bye Mom. Bye Dad.
    Dad: Have a good day in school, monkey.

[Riley starts doing a monkey impression and her parent join in]

    Mom: Have a great day, sweetheart.

[Riley is sat in class in her new school and notices some girls talking]

    Disgust: Okay, we’ve got a group of cool girls at two o’clock.
    Joy: How do you know?
    Disgust: Double ears pierce, infinity scarf.
    Joy: Woah. Is she wearing eye shadow?
    Disgust: Yeah. We want to be friends with them.
    Joy: Let’s go talk to them.
    Disgust: Are you kidding? We’re not talking to them! We want them to like us.
    Joy: Oh. Yeah. Wait, what?
    Fear: Almost finished with the potential disasters. Worst scenario is either quicksands, spontaneous combustion or getting called on by the teacher. So as long as none of those happens…

[back in school, Riley’s teacher enters the classroom]

    Teacher: Okay, everybody. We have a new student in class today.
    Fear: Are you kidding me! Out of the gate! This is not happening!
    Teacher: Riley, would you like to tell us something about yourself?
    Fear: No! Pretend we can’t speak English.
    Joy: Don’t worry, I got this.

[with Joy controlling the console, Riley stands to introduce herself to the class]

    Riley: My name is Riley Andersen. I’m from Minnesota and now I live here.
    Teacher: And how about Minnesota? Can you tell us something about it? Well you certainly get a lot more snow than we do.

[the teacher laughs and Joy starts laughing too]

    Joy: She’s hilarious.
    Riley: Yeah, it gets pretty cold. The lake freezes over, and that’s when we play hockey. I’m on a great team; we’re called the Prairie dogs. My friend, Meg plays forward and my Dad’s the coach. Pretty much everyone in my family skates; it’s kind of a family tradition. We go out on the lake almost every weekend.

[suddenly her memory of skating with her parents turns sad]

    Riley: Or, we did till I moved away.
    Disgust: Hey. What gives?
    Fear: What?

[the emotions turn and see Sadness is touching one of Riley’s core memories again]

    Joy: Hey, Sadness! You touched a memory? We talked about this.
    Sadness: Oh, yeah, I know. I’m sorry.
    Joy: Get back in your circle. [she tries to get the core memory out but it’s stuck] What’s going on?
    Fear: Get it out of there, Joy.
    Joy: Why won't it eject?

[back in class, Riley gets sadder, nearly in tears]

    Riley: We used to play tag and stuff.
    Disgust: Cool kids whispering at three o’clock.
    Fear: Did you see that look? They’re judging us!

[Riley cries in class as she feels sadder]

    Riley: But, everything is different now. Since we moved.
    Fear: Oh, no! We’re crying! At school!

[Joy sees Sadness on the console]

    Joy: What? Sadness, what are you doing?

[Joy pulls Sadness away from the console]

    Sadness: Oh, I’m sorry. I’m, oh.

[suddenly a blue core memory drops down]

    Fear: It’s a core memory.
    Disgust: But it’s blue.

[as the core memory is going towards the core memory holder]

    Joy: No! Wait! Stop it! No!

[Joy grabs the sad core memory and tries to dispose of it]

    Sadness: Joy, no. That’s a core memory!

[Sadness tries to take it from Joy]

    Joy: Hey! Stop it! Let go!
    Sadness: Don’t! Wait!

[in trying to pull away from Sadness Joy knocks down the other core memories]

    Fear: The core memories!

[this shuts down the personality islands and as Joy tries to put the core memories back she, Sadness and the core memories are sucked through the memory tube and sent to the rest of Riley’s mind]

[back in class Riley sits back down]

    Teacher: Thank you, Riley. I know it can be tough moving to a new place, but we are happy to have you here. Alright, everyone. Get out you history books and turn to chapter 7.

[back in headquarters, Anger, Fear and Disgust are left alone looking shocked]

    Anger: Can I say that curse word now?

[Joy and Sadness exit the tube and find themselves in long term memory]

    Joy: Where are we? Long term memory? Wait.

[Joy finds the personality islands have shut down]

    Joy: Goofball Island?
    Sadness: Riley’s islands of personality, they’re all down! Oh, this is bad.
    Joy: We…we can fix this. We just have to get back to Headquarters, plug the core memories in and Riley will be back to normal.
    Sadness: Oh. Riley has no core memories. No personality islands and no… Oh.
    Joy: What? What is it?

    Sadness: You. You’re not in Headquarters. Without your Riley can’t be happy. We gotta get you back up there.

    Joy: I’m coming, Riley.

[they start running to make their way back to headquarters]

[Riley and her parents are sitting, having dinner]

    Mom: So, as it turns out the green trash can is not recycling, it’s for greens, like compose and egg shells. And the blue one is recycling, and the black one is trash.
    Disgust: Riley is acting so weird. Why is she acting so weird?
    Anger: What did you expect? All the islands are down.
    Disgust: Joy would know what to do.
    Fear: That’s it. Until she gets back, we will do what Joy would do.
    Disgust: Great idea. Anger, Fear, Disgust. How are we supposed to be happy?!

[the emotion watch through Riley’s eyes again]

    Mom: Hey, Riley. I’ve got good news. I found a junior hockey league, right here, in San Francisco. And get this, tryouts are tomorrow after school. What luck, right?
    Fear: Hockey?
    Disgust: Uh-oh. What do we do?
    Fear: Guys, th…this… Here, you pretend to be Joy.

[he moves Disgust to stand by the console]

    Mom: Wouldn’t it be great to be back out on the ice?

[Disgust touches a button on the console and Riley’s answer comes out as sarcastic]

    Riley: Oh, yeah. That sounds fantastic.

[to Disgust]

    Fear: What was that? That wasn’t anything like Joy!
    Disgust: Ah…because I’m not Joy.
    Fear: Yeah, no kidding.

[insides Mom’s mind her emotions discuss Riley’s sarcastic response]

    Mom’s Sadness: Did you guys pick up on that?

[the other emotion agree]

    Mom’s Disgust: Something's wrong.
    Mom’s Anger: Should we ask her?

[to Mom’s Joy, who is controlling the console]

    Mom’s Sadness: Let’s probe, but keep it subtle so she doesn’t notice.
    Mom: [to Riley] So, how was the first day of school?
    Anger: She’s probing us.
    Disgust: I’m done. You pretend to be Joy.
    Fear: [she pushes Fear towards the console] What? Okay. Uh, hmm.

[he presses a button on the console and Riley replies to her mother with doubt]

    Riley: It was fine, I guess. I don’t know.
    Disgust: [to Fear] Oh, very smooth. That was just like Joy.
    Mom’s Anger: Something is definitely is going on.
    Mom’s Disgust: She’s never acted like this before. What should we do?
    Mom’s Sadness: We’re gonna find out what’s happening, but we’ll need support.

[to Mom’s Joy]

    Mom’s Sadness: Signal the husband.

[trying to get Dad’s attention]

    Mom: Ahem.

[inside Dad’s mind we see he’s distracted as his emotions are watching the memory of a hockey game]

    Mom: Ahem!

[Dad notices Mom trying to get his attention]

    Dad’s Anger: Uh-oh. She’s looking at us. What did she say?
    Dad’s Fear: What? Oh, sorry, sir. No one was listening.
    Dad’s Anger: Is it garbage night? Uh, we let the toilet seat up. What? What is it, woman? What?!

[referring to dad]

    Mom’s Disgust: He’s making that stupid face again.
    Mom’s Anger: I could strangle him right now!
    Mom’s Sadness: [to Mom’s Joy] Signal him again.

[Mom gets dad’s attention and he suddenly realizes what she wants him to do]

    Dad: Ah, so, Riley, how was school?
    Mom’s Joy: Seriously?
    Mom’s Sadness: You got to be kidding me.
    Mom’s Anger: For this, we gave up that Brazilian helicopter pilot?

[moving Disgust and Fear aside from the console]

    Anger: Move! I’ll be Joy.
    [he presses a button on the console and Riley replies to dad in a snarky angry way]
    Riley: School was great. Alright?
    Mom: Riley, is everything okay?

[Riley rolls her eyes and sighs]

    Dad’s Fear: Sir, she just rolled her eyes at us.
    Dad’s Anger: What is her deal? Alright, make a show of force. I don’t want to have to put the foot down.
    Dad’s Fear: No. Not the foot.
    Dad: Riley, I do not like this new attitude.
    Anger: Oh, I’ll show you attitude, old man.
    Fear: No. No, no, no. Stay happy!

[Anger punches Fear to the side and bangs the console button]

[Riley answer back to her dad in anger]

    Riley: What is your problem? Just leave me alone!
    Dad’s Fear: Sir, reporting high level of sass.
    Dad’s Anger: Take it to DEFCON 2.
    Dad’s Fear: You heard that, gentlemen. DEFCON 2.
    Dad: Listen, young lady. I don’t know where this disrespectful attitude came from...
    Anger: You want a piece of this, pops? Come and get it!

[Riley’s Anger goes into overdrive]

    Riley: Yeah. Well…well...
    Dad’s Anger: Here it comes. Prepare the foot!

[to Dad’s Disgust]

    Dad’s Fear: Keys, to safety position.

[they turn the keys on the console to unlock the foot]

    Dad’s Fear: Ready to launch on your command, sir.

[Anger pulls the lever, the top of his head erupting in flames, and Riley snaps at her dad]

    Riley: JUST SHUT UP!!
    Dad’s Anger: Fire!

[Dad’s Fear pushes the red button that releases the foot down]

    Dad: That’s it! Go to your room. Now!

[Riley stomps to her room in anger]

    Dad’s Fear: The foot is down! The foot is down!

[Dad’s other emotions cheer]

    Dad’s Anger: Good job, gentlemen. That could’ve been a disaster.

[after dad has told Riley off]

    Mom’s Sadness: Well, that was a disaster.

[Mom’s Anger brings up the core memory of the Brazilian helicopter pilot]

    Helicopter Pilot: Come. Fly with me, gatinha.

[Mom’s emotions all sigh in longing]

[Riley gets inside the room and angrily slams the door; inside her mind, a brief tremor shakes Family Island]

[back with Joy and Sadness who have gone through Goofball Island and are contemplating the bridge connecting the island to Headquarters]

    Sadness: We’re gonna walk out there, on that?
    Joy: It’s the quickest way back.
    Sadness: But it's over the Memory Dump. If we fall, we’ll be forgotten forever.
    Joy: We have to do this for Riley. Just follow my footsteps. [as she starts walking on the narrow bridge] Not that high. It’s totally fin… [she looks down and starts to get woozy from the height and nearly falls]

[later as Riley is sulking in her room dad comes to check on her]

    Dad: Hey. So, uh, things got a little out of hand downstairs. Do you want to talk about it? *Come on. Where’s my happy girl? Monkey. [he attempts to goof around making monkey noises to cheer Riley up]
    Anger: Whoa. He’s trying to start up Goofball.

[the emotions go over to look at Goofball Island but it’s still shut down, as the core memories are missing it’s unable to activate, and instead crumbles and falls into the abyss, nearly taking Joy and Sadness with it]

    Dad: I get it. You need some alone time. We’ll talk later.

[he leaves the room]

    Disgust: We have a major problem.
    Fear: Oh, Joy. Where are you?

[back with Joy and Sadness]

    Sadness: We lost Goofball Island. That means she can lose Friendship and Hockey and Honesty and Family. You can fix this. Right, Joy?
    Joy: I… Uh, I don’t know.
    Sadness: Oh.
    Joy: But we have to try. Okay, come on. Riley’s gone to sleep. Which is a good thing, when you think about it. Because nothing else bad could happen when she’s asleep. We’ll be back to Headquarters fore she wakes up. We’ll just go across Friendship Island.

[as the look across]

    Sadness: Oh, we’ll never make it.
    Joy: No, no. No, no, no, no. Don’t obsess over the weight of life’s problems! Remember the funny movie where the dog dies!

[Sadness suddenly collapses]

    Joy: Oh, Sadness. We don’t have time for this. We’ll…we’ll just have to go around. Take the scenic route.

[Joy starts walking towards the labyrinthine storage area of Riley’s long term memory]

    Sadness: Wait. Joy, you can get lost in there.
    Joy: Think positive.
    Sadness: Okay, I’m positive you will get lost in there. That’s long term memory. An endless warren of corridors and shelves. I read about it in the manuals.
    Joy: The manuals? The manuals! You read the manuals!
    Sadness: Yeah.
    Joy: So you know the way back to Headquarters.
    Sadness: I…I guess.
    Joy: You are my map. Let’s go. Lead on, mind map. Show me where we’re going.
    Sadness: Okay, only. I’m too sad to walk. Just give me a few hours to… [suddenly Joy grabs Sadness’s foot and starts dragging her on the ground]

[as she’s dragging Sadness by her leg through the long term memory corridors]

    Joy: Which way, left?
    Sadness: Right.

[Joy turns right]

    Sadness: No, I mean go left. I said left was right like correct.

[Joy goes the opposite way]

    Joy: Okay.
    Sadness: This actually feels kind of nice.
    Joy: Okay, here we go. We’ll be back to Headquarters before morning. We can do it. This will be easy! This is working.

[sometime later as Joy looks exhausted still dragging Sadness through long term memory]

    Joy: This is not working. Are we getting close?

    Sadness: Yeah, just another right. And a left. And then another left and a right.
    Joy: Are you sure you know where we’re going? Cause we seem to be walking away from Headquarters. [as everything becomes brighter] Riley’s awake. [suddenly Joy drops the core memory spheres, Sadness goes to pick one up] Uh-uh! Don’t. Don’t touch, remember? If you touch them, they stay sad.
    Sadness: Oh, sorry. I…I won’t. Starting now.

[Joy looks back and sees the rows of core memories that sadness had touched as she was being dragged]

    Joy: I can’t take much more of this.

[as Joy encounters some mind workers]

    Mind Worker #1: Phone numbers.
    Mind Worker #2: Oh.
    Mind Worker #1: We don’t need all these, they’re in her phone.
    Mind Worker #2: Just forget all of that, please. [he hoovers up the core memories containing phone numbers]
    Joy: Excuse me. Hi!
    Mind Worker #2: Forget it!
    Joy: I need to find Friendship Island.
    Mind Worker #1: Look at this. Four years of piano lessons.
    Mind Worker #2: Yeah, it looks pretty faded.
    Mind Worker #1: You know what? Save Chopsticks and Heart and Soul, get rid of the rest. [the other mind worker hoovers those core memories] US presidents. What do you think?

    Mind Worker #2: Just keep Washington, Lincoln and the fat one.
    Mind Worker #1: Forget em! [the other ones hoovers those core memories]
    Joy: Hey! You can’t throw those away! Those are perfectly good memories.
    Mind Worker #2: The names of every Cutiepie Princess doll?
    Joy: Yes. That is critical information. Glitter storm, Honey pants…
    Mind Worker #1: Forget em! [the mind worker hoovers them up]

[referring to the hoovered memories]

    Joy: Hey! Bring those back!
    Mind Worker #1: They’re in the Dump. Nothing comes back from the Dump.
    Mind Worker #2: Yeah. Look, lady. This is our job, okay.
    Mind Worker #1: When Riley doesn’t care about a memory, it fades.
    Joy: Fades?
    Mind Worker #1: Happens to the best of them.
    Mind Worker #2: Except for this bad boy. This one will never fade.

[he holds up a core memory of Trident Gum’s annoying commercial song]

    Joy: The song from the gum commercial?
    Mind Worker #2: You know, sometimes we send that one up to Headquarters for no reason.
    Mind Worker #1: It just plays in Riley’s head over and over again like a million times.

[they laugh]

    Mind Worker #1: Let’s watch it again.

[the mind workers start singing along to the gum commercial song]

    Joy: Yeah, I know. We all know the song. Okay, real catchy.
    Mind Worker #2: Hey. What do you think, should we do it?
    Mind Worker #1: Yeah.
    Mind Worker #2: Okay. Here we go! [he sends up the gum commercial core memory to headquarters]
    Anger: What the…? This again!

[back with Riley, who’s humming the gum commercial song under her breath as she talks to her friend Meg on her laptop]

    Meg: Do you like it there? Did you feel any earthquakes? Is the bridge cool?
    Riley: Yeah, it’s good. What happened with the playoffs?
    Meg: We won the first game. Coach says we might actually go to the finals this year. Oh, and we got this new girl on the team. She’s so cool.

[Meg holds up a photo of the girl on her phone]

    Disgust: Uh, she did not just say that.
    Fear: A new girl?! Meg has a new friend already?

[Anger starts growling in anger]

    Disgust: Hey-hey. Stay happy. We do not want to lose anymore islands here, guys.
    Meg: We can pass the puck to each other without even looking. It’s like mind reading.
    Anger: You like to read minds, Meg. I got something for you to read right here!
    Disgust: Anger. What?

[Anger grabs the levers on the console, Fear tries to stop him]

    Fear: Wait, wait, wait! Let’s just be calm for one second…!

[Anger makes Fear fall back, he then pulls the levers on the console as his head catches fire, we then see Riley getting angry as she listens to Meg]

    Riley: I gotta go.
    Meg: What?

    Riley: I gotta go! [She shuts her laptop in anger]

[Joy watches in horror as Friendship island crumbles down]

    Joy: Oh, no. Friendship Island! What? Not Friendship.
    Sadness: Oh, Riley loved that one. And now it’s gone. Goodbye, Friendship. Hello, Loneliness.

[Joy sighs in frustration]

    Joy: We’ll just have to go the long way.

    Sadness: Yeah. The long, long, long, long way. [she collapses back onto the ground again] I’m ready.

[Joy starts to drag Sadness by her leg again]

    Joy: There’s gotta be a better way. [after Joy and Sadness encounter Bing Bong] Excuse me.
    Bing Bong: Oh. Ah! I was…I was looking for diversion! [he grabs a core memory and throws it across]
    Joy: What?
    Bing Bong: Ha-ha! So long, sucker! [Bing Bong goes to run off but smacks into a tray of core memories and falls down] Ow. I hurt all over.
    Joy: Wait, I know you.
    Bing Bong: No, you don’t. I get that a lot. I look like a lot of people.
    Joy: No, no, no. I do. Bing Bong! Riley’s imaginary friend.
    Bing Bong: You really do know me?
    Joy: Well, of course! Riley loved playing with you. You two were best friends! Oh, oh. You might know. We’re trying to get back to Headquarters.
    Bing Bong: Headquarters? You guys are from Headquarters?
    Joy: Well, yeah. I’m Joy. This is Sadness.
    Bing Bong: You’re Joy, the Joy?
    Joy: Mm-hmm.
    Bing Bong: Well what the heck are you doing out here?
    Joy: That’s a good question. You want to answer that, Sadness?
    Bing Bong: Wow. Without you, Riley won’t ever be happy. We can’t have that. We gotta get you back. I’ll tell you what, follow me.
    Joy: Thank you. It is so great to see you again. I gotta tell you, I’m such a huge fan of your work. Do you remember when you and Riley were in a band? I went to all of your concerts.
    Bing Bong: Yeah. I blow a mean nose.
    Joy: Watching you play tag was such a treat.
    Bing Bong: Two time room champ.
    Joy: Oh, and remember your rockets.
    Bing Bong: Of course, it runs on song power.
    Joy: That’s right. Your theme song. [starts singing] Who’s your friend who likes to play?
    Bing Bong: Bing Bong! Bing Bong!
    Joy: His rocket makes you yell “Hooray!”
    Joy and Bing Bong: Bing Bong! Bing Bong! [they both laugh]
    Sadness: What exactly are you supposed to be?
    Bing Bong: You know, it’s unclear. I’m mostly cotton candy. But shape wise, I’m part cat, part elephant, part dolphin.
    Joy: Dolphin?

[he starts making a sound like a dolphin]

    Bing Bong: You gotta remember, when Riley was three, animals were all the rage. The cow goes meow, the horse goes oink. It’s all people talked about back then.
    Joy: Yeah, yeah. I guess that’s true. What are you doing out here?
    Bing Bong: Well, there’s not much call for imaginary friends lately. So, I… Um, you know? [he looks sad]
    Joy: Hey. Hey. Don’t be sad. Tell you what. When I get back up to Headquarters, I’ll make sure Riley remembers you.
    Bing Bong: You will?
    Joy: Of course. She’d love that.
    Bing Bong: [he claps his hands with happiness] This is the greatest day of my life! [after Bing Bong hurts himself jumping up and down in excitement, he starts crying]
    Joy: Are you okay?

[referring to Bing Bong’s tears which are candy]

    Sadness: Hey, what’s going on?
    Bing Bong: I cry candy. Try the caramel, it’s delicious.
    Joy: Ooh. [as Joy goes to try one she nearly drops the core memory spheres]
    Bing Bong: Here use this. [he gives Joy his bag]
    Joy: Thanks.
    Bing Bong: Oh, hold on. Wait a second. [he empties it, and a huge amount of memory spheres drop out from the tiny bag] Here. [Joy and Sadness look shocked] What? It’s imaginary. [putting the core memories into Bing Bong’s imaginary bag]
    Joy: Thanks. This will make it a lot easier to walk back to Headquarters.
    Bing Bong: Walk? We’re not walking. We’re taking the Train of Thought.
    Joy: The Train! Of course. That is so much faster, but how do we catch it?
    Bing Bong: Well, it kind of goes all over the place, but there is a station in Imagination Land. I know a shortcut. Come on, this way.
    Joy: Oh. I’m so glad we ran into you.
    Bing Bong: The station is right in here. After you.
    Sadness: Joy.
    Joy: (annoyed) What?
    Sadness: Well, I read about this place in the manual. We shouldn’t go in there.
    Joy: Bing Bong says it’s the quickest way to Headquarters.
    Sadness: No, but, Joy, this is abstract thought.
    Bing Bong: What are you talking about? I go in here all the time. It’s a shortcut. You see. [he points up to the DANGER – KEEP OUT sign above the door] D-A-N-G-E-R. Shortcut. I’ll prove it to you. [he steps inside abstract thought] Look at me. I’m closer to the station, cause I’m taking the shortcut!
    Sadness: Let…let’s go around. This way.
    Bing Bong: Almost there.
    Joy: If you want to walk the long way, go for it. But Riley needs to be happy. I’m not missing that train. [Joy enters into abstract thought] Bing Bong knows what he is doing. He’s part dolphin, they’re very smart.
    Sadness: Well, I guess. [reluctantly Sadness enters in as well]

[the two mind workers come up to the abstract thought entrance]

    Mind Worker #1: Okay. What abstract concept are we trying to comprehend today?
    Mind Worker #2: Um, loneliness.
    Mind Worker #1: Hm. Looks like there’s something in there. I’m gonna turn it on for a minute and burn out the gunk. [she shuts the door; inside abstract through Joy and Sadness follow Bing Bong]
    Bing Bong: What did I tell ya, you’ll be in Headquarters in no time. [suddenly abstract thought becomes activated rendering everything into abstract form] Hey, will you look at that?
    Joy: Whoa. What’s happening?
    Sadness: Oh, no. They turned it on.
    Bing Bong: Never seen this before.

[as he turns his form becomes abstract too scaring Joy and Sadness]

    Bing Bong: [touching his abstract shaped face] My face! My beautiful face!

[both Joy and Sadness have now turned into an abstract form]

    Joy: What is going on?
    Sadness: We’re abstracting! There are four stages. This is the first. Non-objective fragmentation!
    Bing Bong: Alright, do not panic. What is important is that we all stay together. [suddenly his abstract arm falls off]
    Joy: Oh! [Sadness and Joy start falling apart too]
    Sadness: We’re in the second stage, we’re deconstructing! [as Bing Bong falls to pieces]
    Bing Bong: I can’t feel my legs! [picks one leg up] Oh, there they are.
    Joy: Come here, me!

[they start putting their abstract pieces of body back together]

    Sadness: We gotta get out of here! Before we’re not even shape and color! We’ll get stuck here forever!
    Joy: Bong, why did we come in here?
    Bing Bong: I told you! It’s a shortcut!

[they hear the train approaching the station]

    Joy: The train!

[as they start making their way towards the exit door they turn 2 dimensional]

    Sadness: Oh, no. We’re two dimensional. That’s stage three!
    Joy: We’re getting nowhere!
    Bing Bong: Depth! I’m lacking depth!

[as she tries to get her 2D body through the exit door]

    Joy: We can’t fit!

[they suddenly change into figurative shapes]

    Sadness: Oh, no! We’re not figurative! This is the last stage!
    Bing Bong: We’re not gonna make it!

[they change shape again]

    Sadness: Wait, we’re two dimensional! Fall on your face!

[as they all become 2D they exit abstract thought but miss the train]

    Joy: Stop! Stop! No! [after they missed the train] I thought you said that was a shortcut!
    Bing Bong: I did! But, wow! We should not had gone in there, that was dangerous, they should really put up a sign!
    Joy: How long till the next train?
    Bing Bong: Who knows. But don’t worry, there’s another station, that way. The Train always stops there, right before it goes to Headquarters. If we hurry, we can catch it.
    Joy: This isn’t another one of your shortcuts, is it?
    Bing Bong: [chuckles] Yeah! [sets off]
    Joy: Is there really another station?
    Sadness: Uh-huh. Through there.

[as they enter Imagination Land]

    Bing Bong: Welcome to Imagination Land.
    Joy: Imagination Land?
    Bing Bong: Sure, I come here all the time. I’m practically the mayor. Hey, you guys hungry? There’s French Fry Forest.
    Joy: No way!
    Bing Bong: Check it out! Trophy Town. Medals, ribbons, everyone’s a winner! [as he gets a bunch of trophies] I won first place!
    Joy: Me too!
    Sadness: [She just gets a badge] Oh. Participation award.

[as they jump across some lava]

    Joy: Oh, no! Lava!
    Bing Bong: Imagination Land is the best.
    Sadness: Oh, has it all gotta be so interactive.
    Bing Bong: Hey, look! The House of Cards. Ooh, wait. Hang on just a minute. [he finds his rocket]
    Joy: Your rocket.
    Bing Bong: Yeah. I stashed it in there for safekeeping. And now I’m all set to take Riley to the moon! [he extends his arm in excitement and accidentally knocks down the house of cards being built by two mind workers] Oh, I’m sorry.
    Mind Worker: Great.
    Joy: Oh, I love Imagination Land.
    Bing Bong: Isn’t it great? And there’s always something new like… Who the heck is that?
    Mind Worker: Imaginary boyfriend.
    Imaginary Boyfriend: I would die for Riley.
    Bing Bong: Wow. I’ve never seen him before.
    Imaginary Boyfriend: I live in Canada.
    Bing Bong: Anyway, this way, through Preschool World. We’re nearly to the train.
    Joy: Riley, here we come. Woo-hoo!

[back with Riley, she’s about to do the tryout for the hockey team]

    Mom: This should be fun. New team, new friends. There kids looked pretty good, considering they’re from San Francisco.
    Riley: Got to go.
    Mom: Okay. Good luck, sweetie!
    Disgust: Luck isn’t going to help us now. If she tries to use Hockey Island, it’s going down.
    Fear: Which is why I’ve recalled every hockey memory I can think of. [he dumps down several memory orbs]
    Disgust: One of these is gotta work in place of the core memory. [as Riley is about to start playing hockey for the tryout]
    Anger: She’s about to play!
    Disgust: Hurry!

[Fear places a memory orb into the hub and goes to see Hockey Island being activated]

    Fear: We did it, gang. It’s working! [suddenly the hub rejects and throws out the memory orb and Hockey Island stops working, Fear tries to stuff as many memory orbs into the hub but they were all rejected]
    Disgust: It’s like we don’t learn anything. [after Riley misses hitting into the goal]
    Anger: That's it!
    Fear: No, no, no. Breathe. Find your happy place.

[Anger hits Fear aside then pulls the console levers, Riley drops down her hockey stick and storms off in anger to take off her hockey skates]

    Mom: Riley, what’s wrong?
    Riley: Let’s go!
    Mom: You’re not going to finish try outs?
    Riley: What’s the point?
    Mom: Hey, it’ll be alright. Let’s just go back....
    Riley: Stop saying everything will be alright! [Riley stomps off in anger]

[as they watch Hockey Island crumbles and falls into the Abyss]

    Joy: Hockey! Oh, no, no. She loves hockey. She can’t give up hockey. Bing Bong, we have to get to that station.
    Bing Bong: Sure thing. This way, just past Graham Cracker Castle. Hey, that’s weird. Graham Cracker Castle used to be right here, I wonder why they moved it. I would have sworn Sparkle Pony Mountain was right here. Hey, what’s going on?
    Joy: Yeah, yeah. I don’t know. We’ll have to come back.
    Bing Bong: Princess Dreamworld! [suddenly Princess Dreamworld is knocked down] Oh, The Stuffed Animal Hall of Fame. [this is also being taken down]

[as he sees a memory worker taking away his rocket]

    Bing Bong: My rocket? Wait! Riley and I were still using that rocket. It-it-it still has some song power left. [he starts singing the words] Who’s your friend who likes to play?

[the rocket is taken dumped onto a pile of other obsolete memories]

    Bing Bong: No! No, no, no! You can’t take my rocket to the Dump. Riley and I are going to the moon. [the rocket is dumped into the Abyss] Riley can’t be done with me? [trying to cheer Bing Bong up]
    Joy: Hey, it’s gonna be okay. We can fix this. We just need to get back to Headquarters. Which way to the train station?
    Bing Bong: I had a whole trip planned for us.
    Joy: Hey, who’s ticklish, huh? Here comes the tickle monster. [Joy tries to cheer Bing Bong up but fails] Hey. Bing Bong, look at this. [she pulls a funny face but Bing Bong is too sad to look] Oh, here’s a fun game. You point to the train station and we all go there. Won’t that be fun? Come on, let’s go to the train station.

[to the dejected and heartbroken Bing Bong]

    Sadness: I’m sorry they took your rocket. They took something that you loved. It’s gone, forever.
    Joy: Sadness, don’t make him feel worse.
    Sadness: Sorry.
    Bing Bong: It’s all I had left of Riley.
    Sadness: I bet you and Riley had great adventures.
    Bing Bong: Oh, they were wonderful. Once, we flew back in time. We had breakfast twice that day.
    Joy: Sadness.
    Sadness: It sounds amazing. I bet Riley liked it.
    Bing Bong: Oh, she did. We were best friends. [Bing Bong starts crying]
    Sadness: Yeah, it’s sad. [she comforts Bing Bong and he cries (with candy tears in his eyes) in her arms as Joy watches in bewilderment]

[after he’s cried in Sadness’s arms]

    Bing Bong: I’m okay now. Come on. The train station is this way. [he sets off with Sadness and Joy following him]
    Joy: How did you do that?
    Sadness: Well, I don’t know. He was sad so I listened to what…
    Bing Bong: Hey! There’s the train.

[the three of them get onto the train]

    Joy: Oh, we made it. We’re finally gonna get home! [after she accidentally knock down two boxes containing facts and opinions] Oh, no. These facts and opinions look so similar.
    Bing Bong: Ah, don’t worry about it. Happens all the time. [after the failed hockey tryout Riley sulks in her room]
    Disgust: On a scale of one to ten, I give this day an F.
    Anger: Well, why don’t we quit standing around and do something.
    Disgust: Like what, genius?
    Fear: Like quitting. That’s what I’m doing. Sure, it’s the coward’s way out. But this coward's gonna survive.

[Fear tries to go up the tube but he gets knocked out]

    Disgust: Emotions can’t quit, genius.
    Anger: Hey, our life was perfect. Until Mom and Dad decided to move to San Fran stink town!
    Fear: But, I mean, it’s just so drastic.
    Anger: Need I remind you of how great things were there. Our room. Our backyard. Our friends. [suddenly the gum commercial song starts playing] Did I ask for the gum commercial?! Anyway, it was better. That’s my point.
    Disgust: Yeah, Riley was happier in Minnesota.
    Fear: Wait. Hold on. Shouldn’t we just sleep on this or something?
    Anger: Fine, let’s sleep on it. Because, hey, I’m sure jolly fun-filled times are just around the corner. [we see Riley falling asleep]

[as Riley falls asleep the train stops]

    Joy: Hey, hey. Why aren’t we moving?
    Mind Worker: Riley’s gone to sleep. We’re all on break.
    Sadness: You mean we’re stuck here until morning?
    Bing Bong: Yeah. The Train of Thought doesn’t run while she’s asleep.
    Joy: Oh, we can’t wait that long.
    Sadness: How about we wake her up?
    Joy: Sadness, that’s ridiculous. How can we possibly…? [they all notice Dream Production just across from them] How about we wake her up.
    Sadness: Great idea, Joy.
    Joy: Thanks, come on. [as they walk inside Dream Productions] Whoa. This place is huge.
    Sadness: It looks so much smaller than I expected. [looking up at massive posters which look like movie posters of Riley’s dreams]
    Bing Bong: Wow, I can fly. I loved that one.
    Joy: Rainbow Unicorn. She’s right there. [as they try to walk quietly passed Rainbow Unicorn]
    Sadness: My friend says you’re famous. She wants your autograph.
    Joy: No, no. Sadness, don’t bother Miss Unicorn, okay? Sorry she’s from out of town. It’s so embarrassing, right? [leaves but comes back] I loved you in Fairy Dream Adventure Part 7. Okay, bye. I love you. [they come up to a door with flashing light and sign that says, “DO NOT ENTER WHEN LIGHT FLASHING]
    Bing Bong: Huh! Wonder what that means? Oh, well. Let’s go in. [they enter the studio where Riley’s dreams are produced]
    Dream Director: Set up the classroom set! Today’s memories are in, we’ve got a lot to work with here. Riley dumped her best friend, had a miserable day at school and quit hockey. The writers had put together a killer script. [back at headquarters]
    Fear: Just because Joy and Sadness are gone, I have the stupid dream duty.
    Joy: Okay. How are we gonna wake her up?
    Sadness: Well, she wakes up sometimes when she has a scary dream. We could scare her.
    Joy: Scare her? No, no. She’s been through enough already.
    Sadness: But, Joy…
    Joy: Sadness, you may know your way around down here. But I know Riley. We’re gonna make her so happy, she’ll wake up with exhilaration. We’ll excite her awake.
    Sadness: That’s never happened before. [sees a dog costume]
    Joy: Wooh, Riley loves dogs. Put this on.
    Sadness: I don’t think that’ll work.
    Joy: Bing Bong.
    Bing Bong: Yeah.
    Joy: Don’t let anything happen to these. [gives him the bag containing the core memory orbs]
    Bing Bong: Got it. [as she directs Riley’s dream with ]
    Dream Director: Uh-huh. Add the reality distortion filter. [we see they are trying to recreate Riley’s day in the classroom] Love it. Remember, play to the camera everyone. Riley is the camera. Makeup, get out of there. We are on in five, four, three…
    Riley’s Teacher: Hello class. Before we begin today’s pop quiz…

[back in headquarters Fear is watching Riley’s dream]

    Fear: Man, she is one bad actress.

[Fear watches Riley’s dream as they show her teeth falling out as she was introducing herself in class and the student making fun of her]

    Student in Riley’s Dream: Eww, look. Her teeth are falling out!
    Fear: Teeth falling out. Yeah, I’m used to that one. Let me guess, we have no pants on.

[back to Riley’s dream]

    Student in Riley’s Dream: Hey, look. She came to school with no pants on!
    Fear: Called it!

[as they dress up in the dog costume getting ready to crash Riley’s dream]

    Joy: Ready?
    Sadness: I don’t think this happy thing is going to work. But if we scare her…
    Joy: Just follow my lead. Here we go. [they crash the dream running around in the dog costume] Bark, bark, bark, bark…
    Dream Director: Who is that?
    Fear: Uh, what’s going on? [as Joy’s attempt to infiltrate Riley’s dream goes wrong]
    Dream Director: They’re trying to wake her up. Call security.

[suddenly Bing Bong shows himself in her dream]

    Bing Bong: Hi, Riley. It’s me.
    Fear: Bing Bong?
    Joy: Sadness, you are ruining this dream. You’re scaring her.
    Sadness: But look, it’s working.

[they watch as Riley’s sleepmometer starts to swing closer to awake]

    Dream Director: [to the subconscious guards pointing to Joy, Sadness and Bing Bong] They’re not part of this dream. Get them.
    Subconscious Guard Frank: Stop right there!

[they guards capture Bing Bong; to the camera which is supposed to be Riley]

    Dream Director: Pan away. Pan away.

[the camera pans away and we see Rainbow Unicorn getting caught eating cupcakes]

    Fear: Boo! Pick a plot line.
    Bing Bong: You can’t do this. I know people in Headquarters.

[Joy and Sadness watch as the guards drag Bing Bong away to Riley’s subconscious]

    Joy: No, no, no, no, no, no! There go the core memories.
    Bing Bong: Not in there. I’m scared of the dark, please!
    Joy: [to Sadness] Come on. What is this place?
    Sadness: The subconscious. It’s where they take all the troublemakers.

[Joy and Sadness hide to watch the guards keeping guard outside subconscious gates]

    Subconscious Guard Frank: My hat feels loose.
    Joy: [to Sadness] How do we get in?

[Sadness leads Joy off]

    Subconscious Guard Dave: Let me see.
    Subconscious Guard Frank: Have you got my hat or is that your hat?
    Subconscious Guard Dave: Yeah, it’s my hat.
    Subconscious Guard Frank: You sure?
    Subconscious Guard Dave: I don’t know.
    Subconscious Guard Frank: Look at the label. [takes his hat off and looks at the label]
    Subconscious Guard Dave: Yeah, it says my hat.
    Subconscious Guard Frank: Wait. It says “my hat”?
    Subconscious Guard Dave: “My hat”, it says.
    Subconscious Guard Frank: That’s what I wrote in my hat.
    Subconscious Guard Dave: What are you talking about?
    Subconscious Guard Frank: Look. You’ve got my hat on.
    Subconscious Guard Dave: Okay, it’s my hat.

[as the guards argue Joy and Sadness try to break open the gates catching their attention on purpose]

    Subconscious Guard Frank: Hey, you!
    Sadness: Oh, you caught us.
    Subconscious Guard Dave: Get back in there! No escaping!

[they push Joy and Sadness through the gates and into subconscious]

    Sadness: Oh. I don’t like it here. It’s where they keep Riley’s darkest fears. [they run into a giant broccoli]
    Joy: It’s broccoli! [then a door opens with stairs leading down somewhere]
    Sadness: The stairs to the basement!
    Joy: Grandma’s vacuum cleaner! [a giant vacuum cleaner chases after them]

[they find Bing Bong crying inside a cage made out of balloons]

    Joy: Bing Bong.
    Bing Bong: Joy?
    Joy: There you are.
    Bing Bong: Shhh.

[they see Bing Bong is on top of a giant sleeping clown]

    Joy: It’s Jangles. [Joy sneaks up to Bing Bong as Jangles sleeps] Do you have the core memories?
    Bing Bong: Yeah. All he cared about was the candy. [he hands the bag of core memories to Joy]

[Joy helps Bing Bong escape and away from Jangles]

    Bing Bong: We’re outta here. Let’s get to that train.
    Joy: Wait. The train is not running. We still have to wake up Riley.
    Sadness: But how?

[Joy and Sadness look at the snoring Jangles]

    Bing Bong: Oh, no.

[Joy and Sadness wake Jangles up]

    Joy: Hey, Sadness. Did you hear about the pa-pa-party they were having?
    Sadness: Yeah. Yes, Joy. Isn’t it a b-b-birthday party?
    Jangles: Did you say birthday?
    Joy: And there’s going to be cake and presents.
    Sadness: And games and balloons.
    Jangles: A birthday!
    Joy: Okay. Follow us.

[Jangles starts stomping around and following them]

    Joy: Nothing like a good scare to wake you up, right? [still arguing over their hats]
    Subconscious Guard Dave: Okay, it’s my hand writing.
    Subconscious Guard Frank: No, it isn’t. It’s my hat, I wrote that.
    Subconscious Guard Dave: No, but this one’s my hat.

[suddenly Jangles breaks through the gates and Joy, Sadness and Bing Bong escape and finally Jangles scares Riley awake and the trio get back on the train]

    Disgust: [as Riley wakes Disgust and Anger also wake up to find Fear huddled under the console] What is going on?
    Anger: He did it again!
    Fear: We were at school, and we were naked and there was a dog, the back half was…was chasing it, and there was a Bing Bong!
    Anger: You idiot! It was a dream! This is ridiculous! We can’t even get a good night sleep anymore. Time to take action. [he picks up an idea lightbulb] Stupid Mom and Dad. If they hadn’t moved us none of this would have happened. Who’s with me?
    Fear: Um, um, um, um. No, no, no, no.
    Disgust: Yeah. Let’s do it.

[Anger plants the idea to run away in Riley’s head and she takes it]

    Anger: She took it. There’s no turning back.
    Disgust: So how are we going to get to Minnesota from here?
    Anger: Well, why don’t we go down to the elephant lot and rent an elephant?
    Fear: Hey, that sounds nice.
    Anger: WE’RE TAKING THE BUS, NITWIT!

[we see Riley checking for bus tickets on her computer]

    Anger: There is a bus leaving tomorrow, perfect.

    Disgust: A ticket cost money. How do we get money?
    Anger: Mom’s purse.
    Disgust: You wouldn’t.
    Anger: Oh, but I would. Where was it we saw it last? [the gum commercial song comes into Riley’s head again] No! It’s downstairs somewhere. Mom and Dad got us into this mess, they can pay to get us out.
    Bing Bong: [to Joy and Sadness as they ride on the Train of Thought] How about this? Huh? Isn’t this nice? You can see everything from up here. Look, there’s Inductive Reasoning. There’s Deja Vu. There’s Language Processing. There’s Deja Vu. There’s Critical Thinking. There’s Deja Vu. And look at this, guys, memories!
    Joy: Hey. That was a good idea. About scaring Riley awake. You’re not so bad.
    Sadness: Really?
    Joy: Nice work. I can’t wait to get the old Riley back. As soon as we get there, I’m going to fix this whole mess. [looking at one of the memory orbs]
    Bing Bong: Woah, is this Riley? She’s so big now, she won’t fit in my rocket. How are we gonna get to the moon?
    Joy: Oh, it’s that time in the twisty tree, remember? The hockey team showed up and Mom and Dad were there cheering. Look at her, having fun and laughing. I love this one.
    Sadness: I love that one too.
    Joy: Atta girl! Now you’re getting it.
    Sadness: Yeah. It was the day the Prairie dogs lost the big playoff game. Riley missed the winning shot, she felt awful, she wanted to quit. Sorry. I went sad again, didn't I?
    Joy: I’ll tell you what. We can keep working on that when we get back, okay?
    Sadness: Okay.

[after Riley steal her Mom’s credit card this causes Honesty Island to collapse this in turn destroys Train of Thought]

    Joy: Honesty Island? That was our way home. We lost another island? What is happening?!
    Mind Worker: Haven’t you heard? Riley is running away.
    Joy: What?
    Fear: [as Riley is packing to run away] Wait, wait. Hang on, guys. Are we really doing this? I mean, this is serious.
    Anger: Look, we have no core memories. You want Riley to be happy? Let’s get back to Minnesota and make more.
    Sadness: Joy, if we hurry we can still stop her.
    Joy: Family Island. Let’s go! [as they start running towards Family Island the ground starts shaking]
    Sadness: Joy. Joy! It’s too dangerous. We won’t make it in time.
    Joy: But that’s our only way back!

[the ground shakes again and Joy notices a memory orb being shot through the recall tube]

    Joy: A recall tube!
    Sadness: We can get recalled!

[as they try to get into the recall tube Sadness accidentally touches the core memory orbs in Joy’s bag]

    Joy: Whoa, whoa! Sadness. Sadness! Stop! You’re hurting Riley.
    Sadness: No, no, no. I did it again.
    Joy: If you get in here, these core memories will get sad. I'm sorry, Riley needs to be happy.
    Sadness: Joy?

[Joy gets into the recall tube, closes it and gets headed towards headquarters but as Family Island collapses this causes the tube to break and Joy ends up in Abyss and as Bing-Bong attempts to help her he also falls]

    Sadness: Joy!

[inside the Abyss Bing-Bong finds Joy attempting to climb up the cliff multiple times but failing]

    Bing Bong: Joy. Joy, what’re you doing? Will you stop it, please. Don’t you get it, Joy! We’re stuck down here! We’re forgotten.

[Realizing this makes puts Joy on the verge of tears. She picks up some forgotten core memory orbs']

    Joy: Do you remember how she used to stick her tongue out when she was coloring? I could listen to her stories all day. I just wanted Riley to be happy. And now...

[Sobbing, Joy picks up a memory orb that Sadness had told her she liked in which Riley lost a Hockey Game for the team and felt awful is being comforted by her parents]

    Sadness: [voice-over] It was the day the Prairie dogs lost the big playoff game. Riley missed the winning shot, she felt awful. She wanted to quit.
    Joy: Sadness. Mom and Dad. The team. They came to help because of sadness. We have to get back up there.
    Bing Bong: Joy, we’re stuck down here. We might as well be on another planet.
    Joy: Another planet. [Joy has an idea and begins to sing to call on Bing-Bong’s rocket that was dumped down there earlier] Who’s your friend who likes to play? Who’s your friend who likes to play?
    Bing Bong: His rocket makes you yell Hooray! [they finally hear Rocket respond and run toward it] Who’s the best in every way, and wants to sing this song to say. Who’s your friend who likes to play? Bing-Bong. Bing-Bong. His rocket makes you yell Hooray! [Joy and Bing-Bong use Rocket to launch themselves up but fail as they are too heavy, Bing-Bong also sees his arms turning to dust as he’s being forgotten] Come on Joy, one more time. I got a feeling on this one. [they get into Rocket and start singing again] Louder! Louder! Joy, sing louder! [as they launch up Bing-Bong, at the last minute, leaps off as Joy sings]
    Joy: We’re gonna make it! [Joy finally reaches the cliff and lands on top] Woo-hoo! Bing-Bong, we did it! [she turns and sees that Bing-Bong is not there] We… Bing-Bong? Bing-Bong! [Joy looks down the cliff to see Bing-Bong is still in the Abyss]
    Bing Bong: You made it! Go! Go save Riley! [Joy watches in horror and tears up as Bing-Bong slowly starts to disappear] Take her to the moon for me. Okay? [Bing-Bong waves goodbye as he completely disappears]
    Joy: I’ll try, Bing Bong. I promise.

[back in the real world Riley’s mom and dad come home to find Riley’s not there]

    Mom: We're home! Riley? Riley! I'll call her cell.

[the remaining emotions watch as Riley is walking to the bus station]

    Fear: Oh, this is terrible. Wait, is that someone walking towards us? Let’s cross the street. [Riley gets a call from her mom] It’s Mom! She’s on to us!
    Disgust: What do we do?
    Fear: Where’s my bag? [Fear finds his bag and starts breathing into it]
    Anger: Riley needs to get core memories. We keep going.

[Riley ignores the call from her mom]

[Joy starts looking for Sadness]

    Joy: Oh, everything is awful and my legs don’t work. And you have to drag me around while I touch all the… [Joy suddenly sees all the memory orbs Sadness has touched, leaving a trail so she starts following them]
    Disgust: [as Riley is about to get in line to get onto the bus her mom calls her again] Oh, no. It’s Mom again. What do we do?

[Riley turns off her phone]

    Anger: This is madness! She shouldn’t run away!
    Disgust: Let’s get this idea out of her head. [Disgust tries to pull the lightbulb out of its slot in the console]

[Joy finally finds Sadness]

    Joy: Sadness? Sadness!
    Sadness: Joy? [runs off]
    Joy: Wait! Sadness!
    Sadness: Just let me go! Riley is better off without me!
    Joy: Come back! [Joy follows Sadness through Imagination Land]

[inside Imagination Land]

    Mind Worker Cop Jake: Okay, uh, you’re saying your husband was blown away by an elephant. Was he with anyone?
    Cloud: Yes! And there she is!

[suddenly Joy bumps into her as she’s running after Sadness]

    Mind Worker Cop Jake: Hey! Come back here!
    Mind Worker Cop: Forget it Jake. It’s Cloud Town.

[Sadness is on cloud crying as she’s flying away]

    Joy: Sadness!
    Sadness: I only make everything worse!
    Joy: Wait! Sadness, we gotta get you back to…

[back at headquarters Anger is trying to pull the lightbulb out of the console]

    Anger: It’s stuck!
    Disgust: Oh, great.
    Fear: What? What do you mean it’s stuck?
    Disgust: Now what?
    Fear: No, no, no! What is this?

[the console starts to black over]

    Fear: [as Riley gets onto the bus the console starts to slowly get destroyed] How do we stop it?
    Disgust: I got it. Make her feel scared, that’ll make her change her mind.
    Fear: Brilliant!
    Disgust: I know it’s brilliant. Do it!

[Fear takes over the console]

    Fear: Nothings working! What? Why isn’t it working?
    Anger: Let me try.
    Disgust: Wait! You broke it!
    Fear: No!
    Disgust: Move. Move.
    Anger: Let me do it. Get out of here!

[they start shoving each other]

    Fear: Guys, we can’t make Riley feel anything.
    Anger: What have we done?

[back in Imagination Land Joy runs over to Imaginary Boyfriend]

    Joy: Hey! Hey, look at me. Did you mean what you said before.
    Imaginary Boyfriend #1: I would die for Riley. I would die for Riley.
    Joy: Yeah, yeah. Okay, haircut. Time to prove it. [she shoves Imaginary Boyfriend into her bag then creates more monotonous imaginary boyfriends]
    Imaginary Boyfriend #2: I would die for Riley.
    Imaginary Boyfriend #3: I would die for Riley.
    Imaginary Boyfriend #4: I would die for Riley.
    Imaginary Boyfriend #5: I would die for Riley.

[each one gets thrown off the conveyor belt and lands inside Joy’s bag]

[as Joy uses a balloon to blow Sadness on her cloud and in the process collapses the house of cars the mind workers were building]

    Mind Worker: That’s it! I fold!

[Joy then uses the imaginary boyfriends to climb on top of each other and she climbs right on top of them]

    Joy: This is crazy. This is crazy. No, no, no. Joy, be positive. [she then looks at the trampoline remaining on Family Island] I am positive this is crazy! [she sees Sadness floating on her cloud up ahead] Now! [she uses the imaginary boyfriends to fling her herself onto the trampoline]

    Imaginary Boyfriends: For Riley!

[Joy then grabs hold of Sadness]

    Sadness: Joy?
    Joy: Hang on.
    Fear: Oh, I wished Joy was here.

[suddenly Joy and Sadness crash against headquarters window and slide down but Sadness manages to stop them from falling]

    Disgust: It’s Joy.
    Anger: Stand back! [Anger throws a chair at the window but it just bounces off of it]
    Disgust: That worked.
    Anger: Well, what would you do if you’re so smart?!
    Disgust: I’d tell you, but you’re too dumb to understand.
    Anger: What!
    Disgust: Of course your tiny brain is confused. Guess I’ll just have to down it down to your level. Sorry I don’t speak more but as well as you, but let me try. Duh.

[Anger blows his top in anger and as the fire erupts Disgust uses it to burn a hole through the window to rescue Joy and Sadness]

    Fear: Oh, thank goodness you’re back.
    Disgust: Things are really messed up.
    Anger: We-we-we found this idea.

[Joy notices Riley sitting on the bus as it pulls away]

    Disgust: Joy, you got to fix this. Get up there.
    Joy: Sadness, it’s up to you.
    Sadness: Me?
    Anger: Sadness?
    Fear and Disgust: Sadness?
    Sadness: I can’t, Joy.
    Joy: Yes, you can. Riley, needs you.
    Sadness: Okay. [Sadness touches the lightbulb inside the console and is successful in removing the idea which fixes the console and allows Riley to feel her emotions again]
    Riley: Wait! Stop! I want to get off! [the bus driver stops the bus and Riley rushes out] 

[back at home Riley’s parents are frantically calling around trying to find Riley]

    Mom: Alright. Thank you, we will. [to dad] Her teacher hasn’t even seen Riley all day!
    Dad: What?
    Mom: What was she wearing last?
    Dad: I can’t believe this.
    Mom: Do you even remember what… [just then Riley enters through the front door and they rush over to her] Riley!
    Dad: Hey, there you are. Thank goodness.
    Mom: Oh, we were worried sick. Where have you been? It’s so late!

[Joy hands Sadness all of the core memories, causing them to become sad, then Sadness inserts them into the projector which causes Riley to think about them and make her cry in front of her parents.]

    Riley: I know you don’t want me to... but I miss home... I miss Minnesota.... You need me to be happy, but... I want my old friends and my hockey team... I want to go home.... Please don’t be mad.
    Mom: Oh, sweetie.
    Dad: We’re not mad. You know what? I miss Minnesota too. I missed the woods that we took hikes.
    Mom: And the backyard where you used to play.
    Dad: Spring lake, where you learned to skate. Come here.
    Riley: I'm sorry... I'm really, really sorry... I wanna go home... [cries]

[Riley’s parents embrace her as she cries, then Sadness beckons Joy over, the two simultaneously touch the console button causing Riley to create a memory in her parent’s arms which then creates a new core memory that’s a mixture of Sadness and Joy which then recreates a new Family Island]

    Fear: [as they look out from headquarters we see new islands have formed] Hey, I’m liking this new view.
    Anger: Friendship Island has expanded. Glad they finally opened that friendly argument section.
    Sadness: I like Tragic Vampire Romance Island.
    Disgust: Fashion Island! Everyone shut up.
    Fear: Boy Band Island? Hope that’s just a phase.
    Joy: Say what you want, I think it’s all beautiful. [after the mind workers have finished installing a new larger console]
    Fritz: Alright. Here you go. Your new expanded console is up and running.
    Joy: Wow.
    Disgust: Cool. Upgrade.
    Joy: Whoa. [when he accidentally touches a button on the console]
    Fear: Whoops. Wait, did I just do that?
    Disgust: Hey, guys, what’s “PUBERTY”. [she points to the button labelled on the console]
    Joy: I don’t know. It’s probably not important.
    Anger: [looking at the different button on the console] Whoa. I have access to the entire curse word library. This new console is the sh… [just then there’s a bleeping noise]
    Fear: Sorry, I did it again. My bad.
    Disgust: They’re getting to the rink.

[we see Riley and her parents are at an ice hockey game and Riley is getting ready to play with the team]

    Dad: Now, when you get out there you be aggressive.
    Riley: I know, Dad.
    Mom: But not too aggressive.
    Riley: You know, you guys don’t have to come to every game.
    Dad: Are you kidding? I'm not missing one! Go Foghorns!
    Mom: Go Riley!
    Dad: Foghorns…
    Mom: Foghorns are the best!
    Riley: Okay! Okay! I gotta go. [looking embarrassed, she turns to leave]

[as they watch Riley with her parents]

    Joy: Aah.
    Fear: They love us.
    Anger: Yeah, Mom and Dad are pretty cool.
    Disgust: Guys, of course they are. But we can’t show it.

[inside dad’s head it shows his emotions celebrating; referring to mom]

    Dad’s Fear: She loves the face painting.
    Dad’s Anger: Told you it was a great idea. [inside mom’s head; referring to dad]
    Mom’s Anger: Best idea he’s had in a while.
    Mom’s Sadness: He’s a really good guy.

[all the emotions sigh, then Mom’s Anger throws the core memory orb containing the memory of the Brazilian helicopter pilot aside, but Mom’s Fear grabs it]

    Mom’s Fear: Just in case.

[as Riley is about to head to ice rink she bumps into a teenage boy and he drops his water bottle, Riley picks it up to hand it to him]

    Riley: Sorry.
    [the kid looks shocked, we go inside his head where all his emotions are in chaos panicking about speaking to a girl]
    Alarm: Girl! Girl! Girl! [as the boy just keeps on staring at Riley]
    Riley: Uh… Okay. Bye. [she places the water bottle under his arm and walks to the ice rink giving him one last look]

[as Riley is about to start playing hockey with her team]

    Joy: You ready?
    Sadness: Yeah.
    Joy: Alright. Let’s play some hockey! Alright, Anger. Take over.
    Anger: Give us that puck or you’re dead meat!
    Fear: On her left! On her left!
    Disgust: Let’s just try not to get all smelly this time.
    Sadness: Oh, Mom and Dad are watching us fail.
    Anger: Not for long! [last lines]
    Joy: [voice-over] We’ve been through a lot lately, that’s for sure. But we still love our girl. She has great new friends, a great new house. Things couldn’t be better. After all, Riley is twelve now. What could happen?

[mid-credits scene; we’re in Riley’s classroom with the teacher and the other kids]

    Teacher: And who can tell me what year San Francisco was founded? Anyone? Jordan.
    Jordan: Uh…
    [we go inside the teacher’s head to see her emotions all looking fed up and bored]
    Teacher’s Fear: How much more of this?
    Teacher’s Sadness: Five months, two weeks and four days until summer vacation.
    Teacher’s Joy: Then it’s off to the Bahamas with you know who! [she brings up the core memory of the Brazilian helicopter pilot who Riley’s mom also had a memory of]
    Helicopter Pilot: Come. Fly with me, criancinha.
    [the emotions sigh as they watch him] [next we see the girl working at the pizza place that Riley and her mom had gone to when they first came to San Francisco]
    Pizza Girl: Have a nice day. [we go insider her head to see her emotions]
    Pizza Girl’s Disgust: What are we mad about?
    Pizza Girl’s Anger: I don’t know. Whatever Troy’s mad about.
    Pizza Girl’s Disgust: What’s Troy mad about?
    Pizza Girl’s Anger: I don’t know. I don’t know.

[the other emotions grunt in agreement]

[next we see the cool girl in Riley’s class]

    Cool Girl: I know, totally.

[we then go inside her head to see her emotions]

    Cool Girl’s Fear: We’re a total fraud! Do you think they can see through us?
    Cool Girl’s Anger: Of course not! We’re wearing eye shadow.
    Cool Girl’s Sadness: Being cool is so exhausting.

[next we see a clown at a kid’s birthday party]

    Clown: Who’s the birthday girl? Huh? Hey! Hello?

[we go inside the clown’s head to see his emotions]

    Clown’s Joy: Six years of drama school for this.
    Bus Driver’s Fear: What?
    Bus Driver’s Joy: Let’s move.
    Bus Driver’s Anger: Look, this is okay. This is fine. We just need to go to our happy place.

[as he brings down a core memory suddenly Trident Gum’s annoying commercial song starts playing in his head which makes all the emotions heads fire up in anger]

[next we go inside a dog’s head as he smells the pizza a guy is eating as he walks past him]

    Dog’s Joy: [subtitled] I smell food.
    Dog’s Disgust: [subtitled] The man has food.
    Dog’s Fear: [subtitled] Get the food.

[we see the dog chasing after the man now]

[last mid-credit scene; we see the emotions inside a cat’s head which show the emotions all doing their own thing then Cat’s Fear jumps onto the console touches a button which sets off the cat to jump up in fear and rush away]

    [End of Inside Out]
